I have promised my in-laws I would not react to  new info from bro-in-law 1, that bro-in-law 2 diddled bro-in-law 1.  
The diddler is an absolute idiot in the sure sense of the word and this is before we all found out.  Now I am eating dinner across from him.  He is speaking and I am typing this at the table.  My wife looked at my title of this post and looked away.  I am absolutely disgusted, disturbed and on my heels if he even speaks to my son at all.  Promise goes out the window if he looks at my son, nieces or nephews at all. 
This family is brushing it under the rug and not addressing it.  I guess if you don't talk about the poison in the family it goes away.  I have such rage inside for everything this family laughs at, the jokes they celebrate and past stories of success.  He needs to hurt, the family needs to heal.

94108655,reddit,offmychest,1761914377,"How do i convince my mom?

this is a dump account... needed to create this cus protection stuff if something happens... hopefully she changes her mind. you'll know what i mean. its in the **problem** part



so here is how it goes, there is a maharlikan bs going around in facebook (""Rkom main"" is their page, try to search it) about like if you buy these stubs (yes, my mom fell for this if you have heard of this before. The green, yellow and whatnot) you have a guaranteed XXX,XXX,XXX amount of money right? so you buy a lot to multiply that amount is how i believe it works

so my mom believes this specific group and there are a lot groups out there. And runs with the same narrative where we have this secret/stolen? hundreds and thousands of gold then their ""mahal na hari/ supremo / long bs names"" will withdraw that but somehow she believes on this one and all is connected to marcos... somehow. I dont know if this is the full story there is something also about like marcos going to different countries for their banks to open their account to withdraw or something.... but the point is, the narrative is false

 idk how to change her mind on it and its been like a thorn in our relationship where she insists that they are real deal, and i kept saying ""no ma, make it make sense if they're real, that amount of gold is..."" and so on then i said at the end of our argument ""make them come here then!""...

and you cannot believe my goddamn luck. They did. their group somehow sent like 6-7 people to our city to like conduct a meeting/or maybe invite more people?? and ma accomodates them and such wasting our money on those people. and happily, they left on the same day, but the fact that they came is scary to me because this would mean ma now grips tighter unto a belief that this is real. That the money is real since they came and the other fb groups aren't  

before all of this happened, she was just scrolling through facebook, learning about maharlikan narrative bs. And insults them behind the screen ""sino naman magtitiwala sa mga ganyan2x, apaka pekeng peke talga"" (somewhere along those lines). but then her mind changed when someone inside our church suddenly entices her to try and buy this color stubs in hopes of the XXX amount of money and to just try it out, she did. then she even listed my name (----mind you registering for this is kinda of a hassle----). yeah i know, the irony



so here's the actual **problem**,

the rkom main fb group says that by november 21-22, people should come to a place... (i forgot where but it is pretty far since it is in we need to fly and then travel in land when we got there. yes, a waste of money for a false hope. And a bad news since she is pretty persistent on her decision to go there together with me) to avail their stubs?

but the problem is not the stubs, the problem is they're offering a job, an IT one at that, and my ma pushes me to join since the salary is PHP 5mil, 1mil php each day. so from nov 21-22 while that availing of stubs is happening, she insists for me to train for the job. then after that i'll work for 5 days their to get the bag. she even plans to leave me alone cus she trusts me that much.

idk what to do, i just want to show her something, anything that that belief she is holding on to right now, to get rid of our financial instability,  is completely false. idk how to change her mind because we are utterly desperate in these times



These f-ing people irk me to my core. taking advantage of desperate people who needs desperate money, i hate them.

31M I’ve had panic anxiety for a decade and I’ve been surviving. Had a few rough spurts but 10mg of lexapro and Xanax has always worked. This last event started a week ago and Xanax has not been working. I have one bottle of .5mg that’s from 2022 and one bottle from 2024. 

It starts with tingling/tickling sensation down both arms and the absolute worst panic attacks of my entire life. I went to the ER for two nights. No stroke. MRI of brain and spine mostly fine. Thyroid good. B12 fine (have pernicious anemia but shots are taken routinely). Blood sugar good. Literally everything fine. But I don’t feel right and feel like I’m dying. 

My primary doubled my lexapro to 20mg and I’m starting tonight. She also prescribed 1mg extended release Xanax that I can’t pick up until tomorrow. Tonight has been the absolute worst panic of my life. I took .5 and then .25 and then another .25mg of my 2024 Xanax and still nothing. Same tickling feels down my arms, adrenaline pumping. I don’t even feel tired. I have a stressful job but my life is pretty good, very supportive family and girlfriend and I just feel horrible I’m making them go through this and terrified I’m going to lose my job and life will fall apart. I’ve never experienced any panic like this and I feel like my body is screaming something is wrong and I keep wanting to go back to the hospital. My only hope now is that the Xanax wasn’t potent because it has always been my life saver and I don’t know how to survive without it. Please someone give me their experience. I just can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel and I can’t diagnose myself and I’m just so lost and scared",0.07371122,0.02122384,0.005919657,0

144088674,reddit,Anxiety,1762278545,"Looking for answers

Hi everyone! I want to preface this by saying I am under a psychiatrist’s care— I’m reaching out here for ideas to discuss with her.

I have severe panic attacks and social anxiety, 
exacerbated and caused by C-PTSD. I’ve tried a laundry list of medications— I had particularly bad reactions to antipsychotics and bipolar meds, which I think I never should have been prescribed. 

Right now I’m on Celexa, which is helping with my motivation and depression symptoms. But I keep having frequent and extreme panic attacks and anxiety episodes. Xanax is the only thing that can provide any relief for me. It feels like I have asthma and Xanax is my rescue inhaler. Propranolol had no effect at all, and Hydroxyzine made me very tired for several days without impacting my anxiety. 

I’m apprehensive about going off of Celexa because I’ve had such bad experiences with other medications, and it does help a little with the depression symptoms. It’s so embarrassing and difficult to ask for more Xanax— I don’t want to sound like an addict, I am just desperate for symptom relief. 

Are there any medications that act or feel similar to Xanax that you’re familiar with? Could I add anything to Celexa without running the risk of serotonin syndrome?

I’d really appreciate any (non-expert, I know) advice or commiseration.",0.055026773,0.02051482,0.014350293,0

Oh my god I want to evaporate...
I (20F) accidentally sat on my friend’s (20M) lap and felt his d*ck and now I’ve been hiding in my bathroom for like 15 minutes because I’m too embarrassed to exist.

We’re working on a project together so he’s at my apartment right now. We were sitting on the floor because we have a million things like notes, laptops, books, tablets literally everywhere and there’s no space on my table.

We were sitting close because we needed to see each other’s screens. Whatever. At some point I was writing something on my laptop and he grabbed my notes and held them up super high so I couldn’t reach them. I’m 5'5 and he’s 6'1 so he was basically flexing his height on me.

I was so focused on getting them back that I didn’t even realize what I was doing. I moved toward him, tried to push his arm down, and then he moved them behind himself. So I leaned even more forward… and then HE lost his balance and fell backwards.

And I…
I fell right on top of him.
Like directly.
On his lap.

At first I wasn’t fully sitting but then he shifted, touched my leg, I panicked, lost my balance and—
I SAT ON HIM.
FULL WEIGHT.
On his lap.
And I FELT. EVERYTHING.

We both just froze for like two seconds in complete horror.
Then I basically launched myself into the air, said “NOPE,” and ran straight to the bathroom.

He’s still outside. In my apartment. Probably wondering if I died.

I genuinely don’t know how I’m supposed to walk back out there. I might move to another country.",0.6407703,0.29855028,0.059311368,1

Trigger Warning: Suicidal Thoughts, Extreme Self Loathing

I honestly don't know where to start with this. There are so much factors into how my life is going downhill, a lot that it will probably not even end with 2 or 3 posts....

{Also, I don't mean to degrade anyone's experiences or emotions so if it comes off like that, I am so sorry for the insensitive comments. I just want to vent, just spout nonsense to people who would have little to no effect on me. It just feels so, so much better than telling the people I care for.}

I just feel utterly miserable. Unsure of what I WANT and NEED to do with my life. I am second guessing my own desires, not accepting if they are actually mine or what I trick myself to think that I want. I put on masks to decieve others and myself. My words laced with lies and deceit, not to control but to ensure that they do not worry. My deepest and darkest worries eat me whole, a cancerous tumor rotting within me with no available cure.

I wish that I'd dissapear from my loved ones' lives, that I never existed in them to begin with. I want them to smile, to love, to experience it all without me. I want to die, yet I don't want to get hurt. My mind being so contradictory, letting myself get hurt but cower away from death. ""Is this a sickness?"" ""Or is this just all inside my head?"" I wonder why I had been born like this. ""If I had been born more like 'that' or 'that', would I have become better?"" Voices as loud as they coud be screech throughout the days. Yet they are silent, only heard by me. I want to puke and bleed out all of my flaws and imperfections. My mind as frail as the body it inhabits it. My heart burning, my stomach aching, and my mind bruised.

My hope, crushed underneath the mountaib of expectations placed on to myself. It was me who created it. I am so delusional. I wonder if I could survive in this world. My addiction and escape, isolating me further from the light. Yet if I let go of it, I would surely fall into the darker depths of no return. The tears fall endlessly within me but shallowly shown outside. I had broken. No glue nor tape to piece me back together.

Although you dear residents of the internet can send hopeful comments, criticisms, or advice, I can not take them to heart. I do not have the courage to push through my problems with my family so it would be even more difficult for strangers to lend a hand. Despite that, I am thankful for you to check my post. That someone out there can hear my screams. That they care enough to read my distress. That they see me with my problems, not with their biased judgements based on our relationship.

So I recently started a treatment with some anti depressant and lorazepam, I m on day 2. Last year I got the most insane panic attack of my entire life from weed. Very heavy user and it became increasingly intolerable and one day after one puff all I could think about was death and how are going to die and every thing. I cannot put into words how scared I was in those moments. The aftermath was 4 months of being on edge all the time and relearning how to be a normal human again. 

Anxiety got better but recently other things have made it more difficult. Mostly I ruminate on world problems that I have no control over ( wars, climate change, ai, those sort of things). So I decided to go to a psychiatrist to maybe give medicine a try. 

Well fast forward to day 2 I thought about death, trying to fall asleep in the way I did back on weed last year. And I am extremely afraid of the lorazepam acting on my system like weed did. I absolutely do not want to get addicted because it was very difficult to quit and I don’t want to go through that level of panic attack again.

Advice? Do you use lorazepam? Has it ever seemed similar to weed? Yesterday on my first pill I literally felt high.  I am scared. Thank you.

Will also bring it up with my doctor, I needed to hear some opinions until my next appointment.",0.1460314,0.02708937,0.018068384,0

hello y'all. as the title says, i'm getting my first school report on friday (we get 4 a year here) and i'm cooked. for context: grades are from 1 (best) to 6 (worst) and i'm 9th grade  
so last school year i was really good. and the years before too. mostly i had 1s in my school report, a few 2s and maybe one 3. and i was happy with that. i was satisfied with my grades. 

BUT my parents weren't. of course not. else i wouldnt be posting here. to them, every grade except a 1 is terrible. soo... they always yelled at me when i had smth less. at some point i just stopped telling them my grades which they didnt like but they stopped complaining. but now the new year has started and my grades have been dropping extremly

from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3 and i even have a 4. which is terrible. i'm not happy with myself and what i've achieved. and i'm so confused. i dont know what i've been doing wrong, but there hasnt changed much. i didn't tell my parents about anything yet. but on friday we get the school report, which they will see. and i cant hide it because my brother is at the same school and he will show them.

oh and one more thing. i might be a terrible and dumb daughter to my parents, but i would've been the perfect son. and that hurts a lot. 

i'm looking for ideas on how to handle the problem with my parents and what i can do to improve my grades.",0.06184035,0.022384055,0.013345404,0

I’m having a harder time than I expected after the loss of my childhood dog two weeks ago. I thought I had prepared myself she was old and I knew it was coming but since it happened, something in me feels strangely hollow. What’s surprised me the most is how *unseen* this grief feels. My family has already moved on in their own ways, and when I mention her they get quiet like I’m making things heavier than they need to be. I don’t blame them everyone processes differently but it leaves me feeling isolated, like I’m grieving in a pocket of silence. I keep replaying small memories how she rested her head on my knee when she wanted reassurance the way she’d shuffle excitedly when she heard the treat jar the softness of her ears. These tiny things hit me at random moments and suddenly I’m overwhelmed again. I haven’t really talked about it with anyone because I don’t want to make them uncomfortable or seem dramatic over just a pet even though she was a huge part of my life for over a decade. I guess I’m posting because I don’t know how to sit with this alone anymore. I’m not looking for solutions just a place where I can say this out loud to people who won’t judge or minimize it.

I've been doing this since forever, I don't do it physically with like a notebook or anything, but I count it and keep track of it all the time.

Every moment of kindness and love somebody gives me, I keep track of it. Every moment of support and care. I count it. Every moment of pain and anger? I count that too. I have to, if I don't I might be a burden without realizing it.

I try my best to not cause problems, to not demand anything, to never ask for anything because that would be me being a burden to them.

I don't talk to my partners about anything bad in my head, because that would be an emotional burden. So I stay quiet. I stay the perfect image as long as I can. I read an article that a lot of women in relationships with men feel like they're carrying all the emotional burden in a relationship, so I won't. I won't open up, I won't say anything sad or painful or difficult for me, because if I do that I would be just like those guys. Despite the fact that the one thing I want the most is to be held and comforted for just a few minutes.

But here's the thing. I can't sustain it. I start getting resentful of the people I'm dating, because I'm not getting my wants and needs met, while I try my best to fulfill theirs. It starts eating at me that this person doesn't know my bad parts, it's all justt the good. Every gift, every act of kindness don't feel good anymore. They start feeling like silent demands for me to do more, and I start hating the gifts, the cakes, the hugs, the kisses. They feel like my debt to the person is increasing, I'm becoming more and more of a burden to them with every act of kindness to me. I start hating them, because they just keep asking for more and more from me.",0.0466155,0.018710041,0.0052166977,0

199267508,reddit,offmychest,1762715143,"I was bullied by my teacher

Back in high school, I got in trouble for copying a test. Not my proudest moment, but I accepted the consequences. What still sticks with me isn’t the punishment, it’s how my teacher treated me afterward.

The day it happened, I was extremely distressed, almost crying, and told her after school that it felt unfair some people had to study more than others. Not the smartest thing to say, but I was upset. She obviously reacted badly to that and then I left the room. Later, I found out she also made fun of me behind my back to the other students in the room. It wasn’t shocking though, she would be make fun of ppl or be rude during class, and everyone said that about her whether they liked her or not. But what she did to me felt more targeted and personal.

A few days later, before I even knew she had mocked me, she angrily confronted me for saying she made fun of students, because my mom had mentioned it during a phone call with her. I didn’t stand up for myself because I was trying to keep things civil after getting in trouble.

Then, during the next quiz, she tried to isolate me. She told me to sit “over there,” and she pointed to a single desk she had moved into a corner, far from everyone and facing the wall. It was humiliating. I said I felt like an outcast, and she angrily said, “Is this my fault?” 

Before I could sit there, someone in the front row offered to move seats for me, and she didn’t stop them, but the fact that she’d tried to publicly shame me still made me extremely angry. I admit I had extreme anger issues and should’ve just let it go knowing that her attempt failed, but sadly I didn’t. 

I also want to explain, it was public shaming because it was very isolated, and because she could’ve had me sit in a normal seat, like this one back table that wasn’t next to anyone. But she went out of her way to corner me anyway.

I confronted her in an email a couple years later, but that still didn’t fully heal me.",0.16678599,0.056133457,0.021786476,0

Turned 27 last week. Going through a particularly cruel wave of depression. Life seems grotesque and cruel. On paper everything looks great but I fear the world feels like it’s falling apart.

i've been thinking a lot lately about how i don't really have any strong hobbies or favorite things and honestly, it makes me feel kind of empty. when people ask what i like to do for fun, what my favorite movie, or music is, i freeze. i like a lot of things, but nothing really sticks. i'll get into something for a while, then life gets busy, and it just fades. 

it's not that i don't enjoy things, i actually like trying new stuff but i never feel passionate about anything?? I literally dont have favorites of anything because I like everything and somehow that makes me feel even more boring.  and that's starting to worry me, especially when i think about dating. i get scared that if i meet someone, I'll have nothing interesting to say about myself like I'll come across as bland because I can't point a specific thing that defines me. 

I want to connect with people, I really do :( but sometimes I feel like im just not enough?? like everyone else has these stories, passions, and ""things"" that make them who they are and im just floating somewhere in between liking everything but belonging nowhere.  How am I supposed to connect with someone when I can't even figure out what I actually like?

there's a scene in Euphoria where a guy tells Cassie that she's boring and it stuck with me way more than I expected. That fear of someone looking at you and thinking there's nothing special about you, I literally never want to experience that :(

I’m 19, doing my second year of a 4-year Psychology Honours with Research degree at a government college in India. It’s a good place, and I know the realistic path- do my master’s here, clear UGC-NET, and maybe become a lecturer someday.

But I can’t stop thinking about going abroad. I really want to study at the University of Glasgow, do my Master’s in Psychological Research Methods, and just… see what it’s like out there. Experience something different, you know?

It’s not even about money exactly — my parents would probably help if I asked (or not cuz my mother lowk hates me i think) but I don’t want to put that pressure on them. I just wish I could make it happen on my own.

Still, sometimes I feel dumb for even thinking about it. Like, who am I to dream this big? Does it even make sense to want this when the practical option is right in front of me?

98382868,reddit,depression,1761942229,"I have been living my life as if I'd die each next month

Can anyone relate to this? I set my life up for giving up, not for actively living it. I am digging my own grave, I have little suicide preparations going on constantly, I put so very much energy into little goodbye-boxes for some people I love, figuring out which songs I would like my family to play at my funeral, always keeping my things and creative outlets obsessively organized in case I'll leave soon.

I know can change this. 

I want to live. 

I really really do. I am just scared. I am so scared of giving up my weird obsessive system and simply fully leaning into life - which is messy. What I try to do is create something static, but life is constant movement. I hold on to these boxes and my order and it's holding me back from actually living. 

I wish I had the trust in myself, my own energy and abilities to just dive into life and FINALLY create the life I crave to live. It's just so hard with depression because even if one week goes well, the next one could totally break me again. I feel like I can't trust myself. And how am I supposed to live if I am not even stable enough to work? 

I want to be independent, I want to make my own money, move out and do the things that matter to me. Live my colorful, crazy little life. But I make decisions in favor of my hopelessness over and over again. It's a cycle that's so hard to break. Because breaking out of it and simply but fully trusting my glimmer of hope feels so naive.

I really hope I never kill myself. And it's almost funny, because as soon as I think about living, I get even more terrified of dying young - like in an accident or due to illness. I get so cautious. I am scared that as soon as I give up my obsessive system and the goodbye-boxes I'll die and then I leave nothing behind. 

I have people in my life I look up to and adore. I want to live my life more like them. I really really really do. They seem so free and capable, they like what they do, they know what they want, they aren't perfect but they are deeply inspiring and absolutely lovely human beings.

And when it comes to letting go, giving in to uncertainty and movement, I thought maybe I'll just keep Adrian Pimento in mind…

But I'm too scared. Too cowardly. Someone out there please kill me. Kill me and let this suffering of mine end. Don't even try and say that I want to live deep down since I can't do it.

I'm in a dead bedroom situation for many reasons - his health, hygiene, ED, been married for so long... But we have a family that I don't want to break up, both emotionally and financially. I can't see myself ever wanting to have sex with my husband again. I didn't marry him for that, let's just say, and maybe that was a mistake. He is a good person and a good dad. He kind of complains yet makes no attempts to improve his health/hygiene.

Then I found that a (male)friend was in the same situation last year and... we helped each other out. All night long. Then a second all night long. It was amazing being desired, even if we were both just using each other. Then that opportunity was over, and later he moved away. I should feel way more guilty than I do. 

I want to do it again. I'm 53 and in shape and not dead yet!  I don't know that I can survive the rest of my life involuntarily celebate. I want someone to ravage me again like the good old days. I am a horrible selfish person, I know. But I can't help looking around at every dad I encounter at kid school or sports, and think about f'ing them.

My wife is keeps getting mad about this and wants me to help but I see where he’s coming from, from a man’s perspective. It’s all just annoying

We have a big friend group, we’re all 24/25 2000s babies 

My wife’s best friend 25F is genuinely one of the most beautiful women. My wife and I have talked about how it’s literally a curse because she’s autistic, and just in general very shy. She’s nervous around men, she wants to be alone. She has never kissed anyone, and doesn’t want to. Not only is she like that she had a messed up childhood so she’s weird a lot of the time
A lot of times when she has came out with us me or one of the other guys have had to argue with men who won’t leave her alone

For a long time my best friend 25m has been really into her, but he just slowly tried to get to her, hangout with her alone and bring her gifts/treats but you could tell she didn’t exactly love it.

She came to my wife and said he was making her brain shake (she gets these when she’s upset or nervous and it makes her faint) 

Then he started asking her out all the time, she keeps saying no.

She’s been struggling financially and we all know it, so he’s been asking her to move into his house rent free.

She cried to my wife she didn’t understand why he was doing that to her, she genuinely sees it as something mean he’s doing. She doesn’t want to hag out around the group as much, and my wife is pissed. They are the only two women really in our group since the rest are single other than me

All the guys see his perspective. If she let someone in she’d be happier, and he could “save her”. He fully 100% has good intentions, like the guy is offering her a place to live for free.

She’s been alone so long she truly doesn’t know how good it would be for her to have a man in her life to take care of her, and he’s a good guy. 

So we all can see it, she can’t and my wife can’t. My wife wants me to say something but I can’t bring myself to, so I told her to talk to her friend instead and tell her to give him a shot and now she’s all mad

And I’m not trying to sound completely terrible but it would be a shame if she stayed alone. She is genuinely gorgeous, she works at a bakery and is an amazing cook, would make a good mom. Which is another reason for me not to say anything in my opinion",0.295883,0.11797678,0.16801116,0

I(26M) moved to a new town earlier this year and within a couple of months, I met someone(24F). From the beginning, she was honest about how she’d be moving at the end of the year to a state that’s at least 500 miles away. She’ll be moving to pursue a career that she’s always dreamt of having. She feels that this move will teach her how to be independent as she has always had the support of her amazing family. She set clear boundaries and said the move is a must and she has to do it by herself. We both knew it would be temporary. She made it clear from the get go how important these goals are to her.

So at first, we would spend time casually. It was nothing too serious because we knew it was short term, but we really hit it off. We ended up falling for each other. It all happened so quickly. I don’t know if we took it too far, knowing that there was an expiration date, or if it was inevitable that we grew so close. I needed some space to think things through, knowing that she’s made plans to move independently before we’d even met.

After several hard conversations, we agreed that continuing our relationship is irresponsible and we would only end up hurting each other more. I really fucking want to be with her, even long distance, but I think she was on the verge of sacrificing her goals so we could be together. I was terrified that one day, she might resent me for being the reason she never accomplished those goals. Idk, I want her in my life but I’m afraid that there’s no healthy way to do that. I feel happy and lucky to have met her. She told me she feels the same. But I feel guilty for causing her pain at the same time. 

TLDR: dated irresponsibly, broke up with GF for logistical/emotional timing issues, feel guilty for making her sad. Am sad lol.",0.06381883,0.020837102,0.011025362,0

Like imagine her alarm goes off before yours for morning. You&#039;re cuddling and have your hands on her hips. Feeling her butt and have strong morning wood that day. She goes to shower and get ready for work. You still have some time to go back to bed before you need to get up, and have a boner. Fapping takes like 2-5 minutes but showering takes longer than that. So you fap and go back to bed and are dead asleep when she returns 15 minutes later. <br>Maybe it&#039;s a Saturday night and you had sex around 8pm. She went to bed before you and its 1am now. You&#039;re horny so you fap. <br>The problem comes if she went to bed at 11:30pm on Saturday, and its 11:45 and you&#039;re fapping because she&#039;s said no to sex all weekend and you&#039;re desperate!<br>Normalize being comfortable with it around your gf/wife. Because otherwise then its like your sexuality is a secret shame unless she goes full ham. <br>Like imagine you had a long-term illness and couldn&#039;t have sex very often because of how sick you are. Wouldn&#039;t you appreciate your gf/wife fapping in your presence and indulging her sexuality around you even if you can&#039;t join in as often as you&#039;d like to because of x y z?

The ideal would be: the guy is fapping, she walks in, and instead of being embarrassed instead she&#039;s appreciative because she wants him to feel good.<br>I&#039;ve heard stories of like where guys will be getting a blowjob/handjob and she can&#039;t finish him off and so that&#039;s that.

before I begin, my dad is also on the verge of getting xrays next week.  First for his chest then for his kidneys.  The reason he believes he's losing so much weight is he thinks he has a cortisol problem.  He is always on my case keeps asking me why he can't gain any weight.  I remind him of the cortisol.

Now onto the electric company issue.  Yesterday while I was running an errand. Once I came back home my Dad was crying about how the electric company emailed him telling him he now owes even more than what we usually pay for.  He put it on the credit card.

Today this morning he received another email.  He said he was threatened by the company that we will lose our power. The charge is now $600 a month or something like that.  I began to worry too. My dad went on about a time in his life where he grew up poor (he never got over it) and had to live without electricity for three months.

I told him, ""I don't want to hand wash clothes and live like a pioneer."". Then he said in a condescending tone, "" honey, you don't be able to cook. "". My dad treats me like i never see the "" bigger picture "" and makes me feel like I'm so selfish.  Hes made me feel that way all my life. I really hope we can pay our local electricity company.

We were without electricity for three days when a tornado hit our area last year.  It was hell, especially on my pets.

So I m 29, I have a lot of health issues mentally and physically. I've been to doctors but they don't take it seriously and nobody does. Nobody take my health issues seriously, they all think I'm faking so I could stay home with mom and dad. But I want to leave. 

I have ambitions, I want stuff, I want to work but my health issues won't allow it. And I'm doing what I can already to take care of myself. I just don't know what to do anymore. And on top of that my parents are just bringing me down even more. I told them a million time what they can do to help me when I'm not okay, but they just keep telling me they can't do anything. So doctors and mental health professionals won't help me, my parents won't help me. The world is expecting me to act like a healthy person and I just can't because I'm not. 

I've been looking for jobs near where I live but can't find any. And I can't go further because it would too much on my health. And I can't find smaller jobs either, I can't find anything.

What to do when you're already doing your best and it's not enough ? How do you hold on to your dreams when you don't know if your health will ever allow you to have it ? How do you find another dream when you're not sure you'll be able to be healthy enough for it ? I'm feeling really lost right now and down and alone. I don't know what to do with my life.

200526951,reddit,depression,1762708652,"I’m breaking down I think this is really it

I’ve always been a fuck up. I’m 25, for context I’ve struggled with a horrific opiate addiction since 17 (been in recovery for about 4 years) I met my wife back then and she stood by me during it, we were young cheated on each other back then, went down different paths and came back together a few years later. I got into drug court and we got married and pregnant shortly after, things were good she really loved me. I felt great. My states specific drug court program is one of the strictest in the country and her never doing drugs or anything like that it was hard for her to get it. I fell on my face in the beginning, they put a NCO on us because I needed to “focus” on my recovery. Which lead to me being a piece of shit and cheating on her while she was pregnant. Inexcusable by far my biggest regret of my ENTIRE life. Just such a shitty thing to do and it’s not even where my heart lies. We reconciled I told her everything we went to therapy had our son and got pregnant with our daughter almost right after. The 2nd pregnancy was very scary and hard on her mental state. I tried desperately to get her into therapy, a doctor, get on meds etc. she did not want to go. As a result she had anger episodes like no other, got violent said things you tell someone you hate. I’m the type of person that words really really hurt me and as a man it’s hard to admit. We ended up separating (my choice) she wanted to come back bad. She would show up knock on my door etc. we both slept with other people during this separation and I didn’t like it. Felt off, weird, uncomfortable honestly. Lead to a relapse on opiates, literally trying to kill myself. Meanwhile I was paying all of the bills gas etc for her because regardless of being separated I didn’t want to leave her dry. Fast forward to one day, I got a feeling sick to my stomach I had been thinking about life without her the prior weeks and struggling with it I just couldn’t see it. I drove to the apartment knocked on the door said we had to talk, went to the bathroom I was feeling sick at the time from stopping my drug use a couple days prior, and I had the front door close. She had a man over and slept with him. Wasn’t her fault we were separated and I can’t be mad at her. When my wife gets mad she says things to hurt, I’ve learned it comes from her rough childhood. Anyways, she told me he “knew what he was doing and made me cum 4 times” said she was trying to detach from me. I told her when i came over that day, I’ve been a piece of shit my entire life I’m tired of living this way and I want to just scratch and focus on us and the family fully invested, I’d pay for marriage counseling, her own therapy, we’d go to the gym, no codes on phones etc. she agreed and she’s been awesome since I’ve been back. But I can’t shake the day I came over and those words. Everytime we have sex I feel like it’s life or death, I feel insecure, I feel ashamed I wasn’t in the right head space cause I didn’t do anything when I heard the door close. I should’ve beat the shit out of that guy. As a man honestly it makes me feel like a total bitch and cuck. The worst part? This is entirely MY FAULT. These “nuclear disasters” are totally on me. I’m doing it to myself. I don’t know what I’m looking for here just fucking so tired of myself, suicide sounds more and more appealing everyday. I’m embarrassed. I’m the type of person I need to be the best (comes from my bad relationship with dad) and that stupid sex comment is fucking destroying me. I’m not enough. And it’s not on her it’s on me I created this hell and I’m feeling like it’s time to end it I’m done creating hell for myself.",0.50789946,0.24928534,0.053854458,1

Anyone else just constantly buy new things they want in an attempt to make themself happier? In the end it just hurts the pockets more. It seems like every week I have to buy something whether if its big (over $100 USD) or small ($10 USD or under). I had a family member pass away in February and another in March. Since the first one passed away in February I said to myself that life is short. And I just started buying a ton of stuff for myself. Some stuff I didn’t need, but some stuff that can try to make me feel more comfortable. If you have this issue, what was your biggest spending? Last night I just spent over $200 on new shoes and clothes. Does it work for you temporarily? It gives me the dopamine boost for a while and then sometimes I regret it, but sometimes I don’t.

60981117,reddit,offmychest,1761694286,"I regret not struggling

I don't know if struggling or regret are the right words.

I went from high school to university where my tuition and all costs were covered by the state due to my parents income. Graduated with a bachelors in CS.

3 months after graduating I landed a remote software engineering role for $80k.

3 years later I'm making $140k at the same company.

I'm so far past comfortable compared to how I grew up. I really should not have any complaints but I don't know how to explain it. All the people I have grown to know over the years are still struggling as young adults. They feel so much more 'close-knit' and it feels like I'm alienated from the majority experience of people my age.

I know it's crazy to say that I feel like I'm missing out, when I'm missing out on something that causes so much stress. I don't want to struggle with my peers but I want to grow with them.

On top of the increasing loneliness issue among men it's compounded for me at least by the fact that I feel like I skipped over a core period of my youth.

I don't know if anyone feels the same way but I just wanted to try to type out how I've been feeling",0.040925518,0.01890341,0.0041067624,0

when I was younger, I was in a tumultuous and abusive relationship with a boy who eas extremly violent and vulgar, and cheated in me.  It was on and off bc I was stuoid and its one of thise things you have to take the blame for because i did know better at some point. It was a year and a half of my life. But then it was over , and i was ' free ' so to speak. i later met my wonderful boyfriend , and my ex began to stalk me obsessively, in person and on socials.  
I was terrified and ashamed, but time passed and it began to die down. Until this summer. For context , i work with a girl i was formly friends with for a long time, but we sre no longer. The decision to no longer continue the friendship was amicable on my side and I did not bother her. It was a natural drifting away because I didnt like the person she was becoming . 
Well. She has ended up befriending my ex boyfriend  in an attempt to bully and intimidate me , nd she has brought him to my job. His harassment became so bad I have to be walked to my car. 
Im absolutely hopeless. 
Hes infiltrated my life. Im terrified to go anywhere. He leaves comments on my work site, he pushes himself into ym job and demands to be served and seated. He picks up that girl from work late at night, and on too of everything theyre sleeping with eachother in some sick vengeful union

Im so scared all the time. Im unbelievably angry. I get promotions at my job but then have to be terrified and treated like a child bc of how scared of him I am. I cant cope. Im frozen. I cant eat I oversleep I haven't done laundry in over a month. I live in near filth and and tormented by nightmares. I burst into tears and panick attacks frequently, nd ive had troubling coping without being of h@rm to myself. Im exploding on thr people i care abiut , and recently had a pyshcotic break. I am so depressed. I dont know where to begin. I wish this would stop following me.i deserve to live without it . I cant breathe anymore and im so done. I just wish it was over. 

I was crying hysterically I my boyfriends car last night begging him to kill me. I canr handle being tormented so.",0.2854937,0.15343215,0.026609946,0

My anxiety has been making me unable to eat and throw up. It happens every week or so at the moment that its get that bad i have to throw up. 
It usually happens when I confront something that i feel anxious about. For example yesterday evening i wanted to spontaneously go to a party my gf invited me to but as i got there my heart started pounding, i felt hot and nauseous. Then I couldn’t help but throwing up in a bush. Usually it happens when im in flight or fight mode and have to eat ig but yesterday shocked me. I ended up going home. This shit is cutting into my life. Im already pretty skinny but this makes me weak and i feel cold a lot especially cuz its winter. The people i’ve told were understanding and i have been doing Psychodynamic for 4 years now and it has helped me a great deal but this issue is not just in my head but my body ( obv its mental )
and i really want it to get better. 

Why is no one talking about these symptoms of anxiety and stress either ??? Two friends of mine who I wouldn’t consider to have a anxiety disorder also puked from stress and emotional situations like a break up.",0.16043124,0.033460364,0.016862517,0

I’ll keep it brief, really just looking to vent. I’m not even sure anyone’s going to see this. I’m a man in my 30’s who’s been trying to date for a few years now with little to no success on the apps. I don’t think I’m ugly at all, I think I can be very personable and a good conversationalist.

But this is the second time this MONTH that I had a date lined up with someone I was talking to only for them to back out last minute because I supposedly went on a single date with their friend ages ago.

This happened to me literally tonight. A little over a year ago, I went on a date with this girl. I thought the date went well. Conversation was flowing so easily and it was a ton of fun. She got back to me the next day and said she just wasn’t feeling a connection and that the distance was too much. Oh well, we get over it and move on. Fast forward to now, I match with someone on an app about two weeks ago. I’m trying to be super intentional with conversation. There’s a bit of distance, so I asked if we could FaceTime one night to get to know each other. Lo and behold, she cancels because I went on a date with her friend and it’s weird to her. I went on one date over a year ago. I’m tired of feeling like I have to prove myself. I shouldn’t have to.

Wondering how many others have this same isolation/social pariah feelings. 

I’m 32, disabled to a degree since about 24, which took me out of work pool and while I’m not housebound, it makes the world smaller as in my experience making and maintaining friendships was easier in school/work. I tried though, volunteering, being parts of clubs, so on so forth. 

Lack of strong friendships leads into the following, I have no interests or hobbies that really spark joy, except when it’s something I lean toward but is enjoyed by others. I don’t really care for film/television, but if my mate suggests something he is into that aligns with things I’ve enjoyed before, it can open up for me. 

This is great, when it doesn’t make people shirk away from me. I clocked that my diving into enjoying something made others uncomfortable, and backing off, but now that this is there it sucks the joy from the possible enjoyment of the thing because I’m constantly trying to temper myself to not scare someone off. Or I just simply can’t get into it anyways. 

I’ve been described as a bummer once you get to know me. I can fake it surface level, always considered funny, charismatic. Anything deeper than acquaintances and others seem to clock the sad sackness. 

All this to say, I’m alone. I can’t have (nor would I want) children. I’m not in a place for a relationship, if I even could nurture any connection to that point. All my friends are, well, surface. I’m the guy in a group chat that if I’m quiet I’m forgotten. When there’s an event it’s more often than not “oh we just forgot to invite you“. 

Something about me is just, off. And it feels like everyone knows it once they know me. And with the enjoyment button not being able to be pressed unless someone else trips it first, it’s as if there’s not much hope there for even trying to eke out something from life.

It’s been this way for years, probably around 20-22 life started turning gray like this for me, multiple friend group and out of the home connections all falling off, lack of joy unless it’s someone else’s. I guess I just am looking to see there’s others that can relate.",0.05304765,0.02425329,0.009175468,0

Hi, I’m a woman. I’m having issues in handling my emotions especially when I’m alone. I have a live in partner who drinks a lot every other day. Everything that’s going on my life, my dad passed away from motorcycle accident and I feel like the responsibility is pass to me. And I have 1 kid, I have 3 sisters 2 in highschool 1 in 3rd yr college. I don’t even have a job yet. And right now, it feels heavy and when I’m alone i feel so drained I don’t know what to think, to do. Everytime I saw an accident I would remember dad, everytime people left I feel so down and I feel like I can’t live being alone. Even my live in partner left me at the house to go drinking I just started crying so hard that I couldn’t barely breathe. I’m like scared of being alone and left behind.

I’m not affiliated and live in a nice area so i obviously tell them this, they keep pressing me and i notice half of them not looking at me. I pushed the one with the knife off me and ran down the street as fast as i could and hid in a nearby park trying to call my friends.

I am not talking about material possessions, but rather about personal accomplishments, whether big or small, like earning good grades, landing a decent job, or winning something through effort and dedication. 

People should be able to take pride in these things and express themselves freely without being shamed or dismissed, especially when they’ve worked hard to get there. Even within my surroundings, it’s surprisingly common to see others ridiculed with snide or sarcastic remarks, even for simple and normal things like answering a difficult question correctly or performing better than expected. 

What’s funny is that this this behaviour is more evident among people who barely put in any effort and live by the “go with the flow” or bare minimum mindset. 

Honestly, it gives me the ick every time I see this happening, like it signals some hidden animosity or internalised jealousy and it just feels so unnecessary. Learn to celebrate other people and accept that some folks are better than you.",0.11088664,0.061626412,0.0051427023,0

Hi friends,

I just started taking Buspar, half pill twice a day for a week, then one pill twice a day for two weeks. 

I’ve also been on Zoloft 200mg for about 3-4 years now and it’s definitely helped overall but the last three months have been incredibly difficult. I feel like I’m just surviving and not really enjoying my life. It’s a very scary feeling and I can’t help but worry I’m always going to feel like this. 

I know it’ll take another week or so before the buspar kicks in hopefully, but just curious on other’s experience with it? 

Any advice or stories are much appreciated :)",0.06104896,0.017227544,0.012240025,0

Idk if this is the right subreddit for this so forgive me if this post seems irrelevant, I just didn't know where to post.

I used to post a lot before and during COVID but after it I just....stopped. Idk why, there wasn't anyone bullying me nor was I depressed. Idk why I stopped posting but ever since I did, I've been become a ghost online like even my pfp isn't me, it's just random pic I found cool.

It's not like I don't click pics and stuff nor am I socially awkward I'm like....normal. I do have some insecurities about my weight but not so much that it would take over my daily life. 

All my pics/videos are either in my locked folder or I posted them in close friends where no one saw them because only my alt account is in my close friends list. It's not even like I don't have any close friends, I do! I have my sister, and like one close friend and 3-4 good friends and others are okay okay friends.

I've had a terrible day at work, a terrible week at work, a terrible month at work. A disciplinary meeting, then a verbal warning, and now a followup written warning. I have the barest minimum responsibilities now, and I still regularly fuck that up. So naturally I'm upset and spiralling, full of self-hating thoughts and barely holding back tears til I got home. I have a therapist, I'll be meeting with them to talk about it all on Monday. 

Til then, as I lie here crying on and off, I find myself getting sick, genuine fear at the idea of coworkers, family, friends etc noticing that I'm upset and getting concerned for me. I can't really hide when I'm upset, but I hate the thought of taking up space in someone else's thoughts. I dont feel like I deserve to be worried over, I'm not a valuable enough coworker/friend/whatever to justify someone thinking about me later. I don't feel like I'm worthy of being cared about so much, so it makes my stomach sink and my chest gets all tight if I think about it. I can't tell any of my friends about this, because then they'll be concerned and worry about me and I don't want that. I don't want to be a burden on them by sharing that I'm having a shitty time and bring them down. I don't deserve anyone's time or affection, I'm worthless and terrible at my job and make so many mistakes and never fucking learn.

132650964,reddit,offmychest,1762208905,"How violent corn ruined my life.

Warning there is some heavy stuff that could be triggering but nothing super gross because this isn’t smut it’s just something I needed to talk to someone about,  get off my chest. 

Outside of the bedroom I’ve never been violent or angry guy. I’ve never been in a fight with another man I’ve never even raised my voice to a girl…. I’m genuinely a nice person.. on the surface. 

I found pornography very young like 8 or 9years old. The Parents didn’t know what the internet was but they got WiFi and laptops for me and my sister because they thought we might enjoy YouTube or video games. 


It was something I grew up with it became very normal for me. I’m cutting out a lot of back story on the progression to violent porn here because this will probably end up being a long post. 

When I was in my pre teens 50 shades of grey the book got really popular and that introduced me to that genre of porn. For a kid who had been watching vanilla stuff for several years. this was a game changer. The exact thing I needed it was new and it turned me on a lot. It got to the point where that type of violent porn was the only thing that turned me on. It got so bad that eventually to me 50 shades of grey was weak vanilla wanna be bdsm. 

My brain auto blocked out anything vanilla online and Id just be focused on finding the most violent videos I could find. Videos that have been taken down and aren’t even allowed on most sites these days. 

 In high school I began sleeping around. I never did anything out of the norm because I was still figuring out sex first hand. Towards the end of hs is when I began to get rougher girls seemed to love it and eat it up. When I’d sext girls they always talked about wanting it rough I guess because our culture glorifies that. 

Then when I got to college it became a lot worse. I was 18 when I started going out with this med school girl she was like 23. I had been in a dry spell since high school so when we slept together for the first time I went much rougher than I usually did. I got her to finish multiple times and she said she’d never been with such a great lover and she loved it all. Word spread I guess because Her roommates began to look at me different, her friends liked hitting on me some even out right asked me to explain in detail what exactly I would do that made the med school girl praise sleeping with me so much. Like 6 different girls all wanted to sleep with me. Needless to say I felt like a king. 


All my experiences up to this point coupled with my history or porn led me to have a sick idea of what sex was.  I figured that’s what girls wanted that’s what they all craved every time I got rougher they just ate it up. While I was still seeing the med school girl I began to sleep with some of her friends it was always the same thing they liked it rougher. This went on for months and I was quickly moving from rough sex to violent sex. It was a slippery slope with no bumps until… 

That summer I began seeing the girl next door to my apartment. When we made it to the bedroom after a few dates I began to “make love” the way I liked it I grabbed her by the throat and pulled her in for a kiss she started kissing me back and then I kind of pushed her onto the bed climbed on top of her and pulled her by the neck in for more kissing that’s when this girl just immediately froze she stopped kissing me back. I asked her if everything was ok and she asked me if I could go slower. Strange question… (not really but that’s how fucked up I was) but we kissed slow and soft then when we began to have sex she asked me two or three times to slow down or to be gentle. Eventually she started just coaching me on how to have vanilla sex. Like two to three strokes a minute instead of the pace I was used to. After a few hours we were laying in bed cuddling in between sessions she asked me if I watched porn. Without hesitation I was just like “yeah why?” She looked off into space and replied “nothing”  


It never hit me that normal people don’t do that, that kind of sex isn’t supposed to be normal. What we did that night was “normal” sex. It was ok but for the most part I didn’t feel satisfied. 

I forgot about that night mostly then a few months later the med school girls roommate was having a birthday party. That night instead of hooking up she told me she didn’t like what we had been doing. The sex was too much and she had began to feel scared whenever we were going to hook up. She felt like at times I was actually getting fulfillment out of hurting her. She said there’s been a few times when she tried to tell me to stop but she was too overwhelmed to do so. She said sometimes when i was grabbing her by the throat while inside of her she couldn’t say she didn’t like it or to slow down because of everything going on and that she physically couldn’t speak. She said sometimes she felt like she was being sexually assaulted she said onetime I wasn’t paying attention and she blacked out for a second when I was choking her and she came to with me hammering away at her and she never felt more scared in her life then she said she also never climaxed as hard in her life as that time. Then she said that she would always just go along with it because she would get off harder and more often than she ever has so she figured she must like it. She said she didn’t blame me for any of it and that I was a nice guy it was her that issues… she needed time to figure herself out and she didn’t want to continue to see each other till she did. 


Her roommate asked me to hangout while I was leaving. By that point we had slept together several times before and med school girl knew / was ok with it. So we got baked in my truck and then we ended up sleeping with each other again that night. Her roommate was also sick like me she loved that stuff genuinely. This time when we hooked up it felt different… it was like I was no longer on auto pilot just going off instinct. I was fully aware of everything I was doing. I thought about how it turned me on that I was loving medical school girl so good she couldn’t form words. After I finished the post finishing clarity hit. it all felt wrong I got up before anyone and went home. 

At my house I got baked alone and thought about it all that conversation with med school girl shook me to my core it was like someone had turned the light on. all of a sudden I thought about everything I had been doing I looked at my sex life and I got really uneasy. Because I did get some sick gratification out of it. I liked being rough to the point where it was hurting her I liked when they winced in pain as much as I liked when they moaned in pleasure and I thought it was just normal… 

I became sick to my stomach. To say i felt deeply disgusted and ashamed doesn’t even begin to describe what i felt. I stopped having sex and pursing romantic relationships all together for over a year or two because I was just genuinely disgusted at the animal I had become and I was scared I was going to hurt someone I was scared of all the times I had already hurt someone. 

Even after I began to open up to the idea of dating again I would see a girl for as long as I could without sleeping with her. When she wanted to finally cross that bridge I’d make up some excuse as to why we weren’t a good fit and I’d stop seeing her. 

That was about 4-5 years ago

it’s all seriously affected and left permanent damage on my love life. I struggle a lot with intimacy now. Im a terrible lover now. You know how great sex is supposed to be instinctual? You’re supposed to just let go and let whatever comes natural happen. because of the monster that is what I am I don’t let myself do that. I’m scared of hurting someone or just returning to that sick young man I used to be. People don’t change he’s still inside of me I can feel that version of me still there. 

It’s all cost me multiple relationships because it’s like I’m holding back now and I know that my partners can sense something’s up like your hearts not all the way in it. It’s like sex is awkward now. They don’t know why you’re holding back they just know something’s wrong they can feel it. 

When girls have asked me to be rougher with them I try and I can’t they can usually feel that I’m forcing it and it’s a huge turn off for them. I’ve lost a few decent girls due to these intimacy issues. 

All of my past experiences. I ask for consent more than I should during sex constantly “are you ok with this ? Are you alright? Do you like this?” Some girls think it’s sweet some girls think it ruins the intimacy. 

What I really struggle with is the awkwardness now. It no longer feels like I’m the one making love to a girl it feels like I’m pretending to be someone else. In case you were unaware that’s not a good way to have sex. It’s the most intimate thing you can do with a person and due to that fact they can always tell something’s off. Sometime wrong. They don’t know that you’re holding back the real you or that you’re scared to let go and just go for it because of your past. 

If I had to guess the number of partners I’ve had I’d put it at around 20 but because of these issues and now that I control myself and behave a certain way during sex. Now that I hold back and I’m nervous about everything  I’ve been asked if I was a virgin several times because of how timid / hesitant I am 


And unfortunately due to today’s social norms and society’s expectations. If you don’t have great sex the first time together it’s rare you get a second chance. Still I live with these consequences. I figure it’s my penance for the disgusting things I’ve done.",0.3389984,0.100019015,0.022188433,0

Soo I'm a female in my early 20s and I have a huge bust since I was a teen. And because of this i get a lot of unwanted attention from sexual predators. I was talking to a guy since 4-5 months, we met once, and couldn't meet after coz of busy schedules. He was the kind of guy who i thought was emotionally available, understanding, sensitive and didn't gave me any bodily compliment (which usually men do within 2-3 days of talking stage and it was a big thing for me or maybe he was playing safe idk). And this was also the reason that I was taking it slow but knew I'd definitely choose to date this guy coz maybe he's naive for those things and for once I wanted to feel loved and not lusted again. But then recently a few days back he said ""you do look like a Mexican latina= you're hot"" and what I'd thought all this time that this guy wouldn't do it but did it (it bothered me but I was like obv men will be men, how cud they keep their real thoughts in mind for long but I let it slide coz it was after a long time and we were frank now). Also I made it clear that this is a non negotiable for me, that I can flirt or have a bit of fun in chat but that doesn't imply I only want this, I'd like to know more about your other qualities rather than just the steamy stuff, coz ofc the fun was just part of a bigger thing and not just the only thing we connected for and he agreed to it. And yesterday while we were sharing some edgy reels he said "" my friend's flat is free on 21st during day"" and my reply was ""what should I do with that info?"" And he says ""i thought you wanna try that out"" and I was like wtfff?? I'm literally a lover girl typa woman and you thought I'd give myself soo easily to you, and just coz you thought I flirted a lil with you soo i was up for hookup? Even tho I made it clear to youu just a few days ago that intimacy(sexual) was never a priority for me! I gave him few seconds to realise his mistake but he didn't and I blocked him immediately. 

After 2 years I finally talked to a guy i thought was different, who liked me for my personality but I was wrong ig, I could not realise his real  traits and I feel so sick rn, I feel like harming myself I don't want this body yaar, I just want to feel normal, I'm more than this.",0.37751234,0.12702756,0.20088354,0

Soy mujer y estoy teniendo un montón de problemas para hablar de ciertos temas en terapia.
Cuando fui al psicólogo, me sentí rara: cuando me dijo cosas positivas sobre mí, no pude creerle. Siento que lo dice porque es su trabajo, no porque sea verdad.
También repetí 'no sé' como mil veces y me quedé con la sensación de que pensó que soy tonta.

Otra cosa que me incomodó fue cuando me preguntó por un tatuaje que tengo cerca de la muñeca; sentí que estaba analizando algo que yo no estaba lista para explicar.

Pero lo más difícil es que no sé cómo hablar sobre lo mucho que me afecta el tema de la infidelidad. En mi familia se normaliza muchísimo: mi mamá está casada y aun así está con otros hombres, y mi hermana también avala situaciones parecidas en otras personas.
No sé cómo llevar esto a terapia porque siento que es un tema muy pesado, como si no fuera 'mío' sino de mi familia… pero igual me afecta un montón y me genera mucha bronca y confusión.

¿A alguien más le pasa que hay temas familiares que no saben cómo abrir con el psicólogo porque sienten que son demasiado complicados o vergonzosos?",0.09033044,0.03489272,0.01087737,0

Recently, I’ve been struggling with this huge feeling of being unwanted and hated. Everything in me is saying I should just end it all. It’s so stupid though. I know it’s irrational but I’m so upset. I don’t even know why I’m as upset as I am. It’s not like I’ve ever really been wanted or particularly liked. I’m a ghost. I wonder around and people can sorta tell I’m there but don’t care since I’m not malignant. I wish I had some sort of personality. I wish I was more likeable. I wish I knew how to talk to people. This whole month has been the absolute worst. It’s just me constantly thinking in circles. It doesn’t stop and when it does I just circle back. I just feel so useless. I’ve never been one to self harm but recently it’s all I can think about. I was doing so much better. I felt happy, I didn’t care what others thought.

24336865,reddit,offmychest,1761431317,"Boyfriend Broke Up with me

So tonight my boyfriend of 5 months broke up with me.

He’s been very cold and distant for the past 7 days - barely replying. He said he was stressed about his mum and I was aware there were family issues but he never told me exactly what even after asking.

I’ve felt so anxious all week long because I’ve had no communication. I finally convinced him to call me tonight after sending a few texts begging that he calls me. On the phone he promised it’s nothing to do with me he’s just so stressed about his mum - but still wouldn’t say exactly what was wrong with her. He said he feels like he can’t be in a relationship right now due to the stress. He said he hasn’t talked to his dad or friends about the issues and is bottling it all up. He sounds very depressed to be honest. I urged that he talk to someone about it even if it isn’t me. I begged him not to do anything stupid, he said he wouldn’t.

I tried to convince him that burning down his support network when he feels like this is a bad idea. I said that I respect that him needing space to deal with things is his way of handling it and I don’t mind going on a break, but he needs to tell me that first and check in every x amount of days/weeks. He said he would feel too bad for making me wait and wanted to fully break up. I said either way I will be hurt, and I’ll feel worse if he breaks up fully, because at least on a break I can make sure he is mentally well. He kept saying he just wants to be on his own. So I have to respect that, and there’s nothing else I can do. I told him to just think about it and call me/text me tomorrow if that’s definitely what he wants to do, and he said he will.

I know a lot of you will probably say ‘just leave’ and that it’s a waste of my time sticking around. But this relationship has been the best I’ve ever had and we were really building something amazing. I really do not think he is making up excuses or lying about this and he also promised that this isn’t an excuse to soften breaking bad news. I just feel really sad, let down, angry, disappointed, worried about him.

I have friends and family coming soon so I can speak to them about it.

Edit: One of my friends said it might be an idea to text his friend that I have on socials that I’m worried about him and his safety - but idk if it’s my place to do that really.",0.16678599,0.03335018,0.01656105,0

I am writing this maybe because I need to get it off my chest, maybe not. Honeslty, I don’t really know anymore, well, to do a little summary of my situation : 

When I was a kid, I was beaten up by my parents, it was pretty bad. Everyday, everyday I was getting beaten, for nothing and everything at the same time, for bad grades, for talking to high, for having different ideas. The worst part is : I don’t remember anything almost from my childhood, some stuff, but most of it, it’s gone from my brain, people tell me I did this and that, it feels like a different person, not me. 

This is one thing, I thought by giving myself time, I won’t think about it anymore, while I don’t actively do it, it feels like my life is a mess, I get so attached to people, I don’t want to take accountability for the things I do badly, and honeslty, I don’t really care anymore. 

After the break up with my ex boyfriend, I though I could handle it, I could be trying to be normal, then, he broke up with me, and I understood, I will never be normal, ever ever. 

This is a goodbye message, I don’t really feel like talking to anyone I know, I don’t have that much friends anymore, I did a promise to someone to hold on an another year, but frankly, no, I don’t want, I am tired. Tired to be someone who always has problem, tired to be myself. The best is to just let go, this is what I am doing.

I will hold on an another month, because I am thinking: They would need me at work, it’s Christmas season, and if I don’t show up, it will be suspicious right ? So here I am, 2026, not waiting for anything, just, ending things at this time. I am happy, this is the end, I am stopping the bed rotting, I am stoping the suffering, oh gosh, I can’t fucking wait.

obligatory throwra

TW// MENTIONS OF SUBSTANCES AND SA

Hi everyone,

I need advice about a situation I have found myself in. I (F21) have been living with my roommate N (F22) for about three years now. We have had another roommate, E (F21) this whole time, but she does not stay with us often. We met in the university dorms and have lived together since. I have two dogs, one who is 13 and another new addition who is 4. Now, we live in a large house with a yard, so there is plenty of space. N also has two cats, but with the house the size that it is, there is no issue. Anyways, I have had issues with N and did not realize how bad it was. I have been wanting to move out and ghost N, but I have been unable to find other roommates in a timley manner, in an area that is safe and something affordable. Anyways, I thought that I would be able to handle one more year with N. Boy was I wrong.

N has done so many inconsiderate and immature things, it makes it hard to interract with her in many instances. For example, I left my 13 year old dog in my room while I went to work (for context: he was not getting along with one of the cats and so we kept them seperated). Anyways, N knows that my dog LOOOOVES to eat. Absolutley anything edible, he wants. Anyways, she let him out of the room, put a bag of lindt chocolates on the ground and he got to them. I came home from work and I could not find my dog. My heart sank because I found the wrappers. HALF A FUCKING BAG OF ASSORTED CHCOLATES. He was ok in the end thankfully, but because of his size there was a good chance he could have died. After this, she has continued to put him in harmful situations, including leaving weed and shrooms out and letting him out of the common areas.

If this was not enough, there is more. She had a boyfriend who was almost 40 and was racist, sexist, and homophobic. He made comments about hating foreigners, knowing that I am a first generation in this country, and that my now fiancée (F26) is also a foreigner. She allowed him into our home, left him home with me, and refused to see any issues with the ""pranks"" he tried to pull with me. His ""pranks"" were him scaring me and playing victim when I said something to him and N about it. ""I'm sorry,"" or ""it was just a prank, calm down it's not that big of a deal"". She defended him and him coming over, and one day I snapped. I said some things that may not have been kind, not my best moment, about how she needs to grow up and be considerate of hers around her. She did somewhat change that day.

This context is important for the next part. About one year ago, someone me and N work with tried to coerce me into having sex with him. N knows him and what he did. N tried to say she supported me and would be there for me. I knew that he had sold weed, but had no clue that N had been buying from him months before this incident, and had continued to buy from him after. Knowing the things he did to me, the nights I woke up in panic from it and unable to sleep. Nights I was scared he would find me and he would harm me. She knew all of this, and still bought from him. The same girl telling me she saw me as my sister and all of these things, bought from the man who gave me such immense trauma because he wanted something that i did not. I chose to forgive her, because we still had a year of the lease left at this point.

My fiancée HATES N. When my fiancée and I began dating, N was obsessed with us hooking up, where we were going, when we were going there, what we were doing, and would make comments about how hot my fiancée is, and how she would try to get with her if I was not with her. My fiancée and I met when she was doing an exchange in my country, we had a casual fwb going on and then it grew into something much much more. I mean, we are planning on getting married! Anyways, it is to the point where my fiancée is insistant that N does not even know when we are getting married. The wedding will be in my fiancée's home country, and we will be streaming it for the people in my country to see, and she does not want N to have access to it. My fiancée is so angry with all of the things that she has done to me. N has done larger things like I have said, but many smaller things as well (i.e- throwing a bag at a wall we share during a breakdown at 2am... the only wall we shared).

I got my 4 year old dog to be a sort of company to my 13 year old. He is old and struggling in many ways. I don't want him to be alone twords these end stages, and I know once he does pass I will not be ok. I know it is coming, as sad as it makes me. The 4 year old is high energy, and he can be a bit difficult at times. However, she has not said anything to me directly about his behaviors. He broke our vinyl blinds, and so I said I would pay for them, no issue (he is in a cone and tries to look out the window with the cone on). N has two cats, as I previosly stated. Her cats have swatted and cornered both of my dogs. They would come into my room and corner them when I would leave the room for something. I tried to talk to N about this, and she became annoyed and said ""yea but I can only do so much about it"". Anyways, I came home today and N came up to me kind of laughing and joking saying ""I know how to get your 4 year old dog to stop barking so much"". For context: He barks when people are at the door or when someone walks in, he stops a few seconds later, like any other dog!! Anyways, I asked how and she said ""I sprayed him with a spray bottle."" I think this moment made me finally snap.

I looked at her and said ""why did you not say anything to me before?"" She said ""it was only once,"" and I said ""I don't care, if I sprayed your cat with water only once, you would be pissed with me! You didn't talk to me about doing it before, which I would have not been ok with, and you did not tell me after either"". I also pointed out how she got a bottle for the sole purpose of spraying him, and did not think to mention it to me either.I am trying to keep my composure at the moment, and trying not to let my temper get to me. But damn it, after years of this shit I feel I can't handle it. I have the wedding to my fiancée's home country to marry this year, and I just want to stay. I am estranged from my family, I only have two friends who live in different parts of the country. I feel tired of dealing with N's shit, because these mentioned things are only the tip of the iceberg. I want her to take accountibility, instead of being pissy and ignoring me the way she is now. How is it my fault you didn't talk to me about this before? I want to go and yell at her because she never apologizes, sincerely. I want to emphasize I know this is wrong, I will not do this. I feel so much sadness and pain in my heart because of this. Anyways, does anyone have any advice?",0.14256015,0.0279513,0.017364962,0

When I really think about it, I don’t even have any reason to feel as sad as I do. I have a good life- I have loving friends and family and multiple hobbies that I love and pursue daily.  But I still feel like my head is full of water and I want to cease to exist constantly. I want to hibernate forever. No matter what I try; medication, therapy, exercise, patience, etc., I remain internally grumpy, numb, exhausted, legs shaking whenever I sit. I disappoint people and let my loved ones down. I never feel rested and I always feel like I’ve committed a terrible crime. I don’t know what’s happening and I’m scared. I feel like I’ve accidentally snuck onto Earth and everyone can tell I’m not supposed to be here. I’m so tired of being in this vessel I want to be someone else or I’ll explode. 

I just want to feel okay. If someone could please give me some words of advice or comfort I’d greatly appreciate it. Thanks",0.050326355,0.017227544,0.0070665907,0

269916292,reddit,depression,1763186559,"I miss it sometimes

I have struggled with depression since my teenage years.

Right now I'm on an adventure of a lifetime, working hard, being physically active, reading books and making friends. I've never felt better. Most of the time I love it. It's everything I ever wanted in that dark room, alone and lonely, hating everything around me but mostly myself. 

And yet there are times when I miss it. I miss not having responsibilities, places to be. I miss gaming all night, sleeping all day. My meals were junk food and cigarettes, and my hobbies were masturbating and writing. 

It's like I don't remember scraping that terrible feeling of emptiness for an inkling of self loathing. The envy I felt as I stalked people I used to know on social media, watching as they put behind them achievement after achievement. Finishing school, travelling, becoming moderately famous in their online niche.

Everyday I wake up to terrible news about the world and I feel like I'm losing faith in humanity. It pushes me into the deep, black sea of nihilism, where nothing matters anyway. There it waits for me, the sweet, soft demon-friend, whispering to come back. 

I'm not going to. Never again, even if it might crawl back into my head, I will never let it get that bad again. 

But sometimes I wish I could go back. 

I can't really talk to my friends about these things, they would just look at me like I'm broken. My wife, while she would understand, is on a high right now and I don't want to bum her out. So I came here.

First of all sorry for my english im not a native speaker 

Few days ago i underwent a stressful situation with the insurance company for hours since then about5 days till now Ive been experiencing weird symptoms its like the thing you do after crying where you make sudden gasps for air or spasm i dont know how to explain in, its been going on for days and every few minutes and i get these jerks, its basically like a slight unnoticeable tick, with a sensation of my tongue closing my airway for a less than a second. IM almost sure its because of my anxiety and the stressful situation ive been in i just wanna know if its common and how can i manage it.

Going to a doctor is not an option right now and im having surgery in a few days after fighting with the evil insurance company.

Hi there,

I'm looking to get on anxiety medication to improve my near constant anxiety - I don't get panic attacks but have suffered from basically an uninterrupted state of anxiety for the last two years at minimum. What I'm worried about with benzodiazepines is that I imagine they must make your head cloudy as they're sedative. Has that been your experience? Is there any anxiety medication that has succeeded in calming you down while not compromising your mental clarity? What side effects have you encountered generally?

261886158,reddit,Anxiety,1763079926,"I hate how much anxiety is affecting me and wont go away

I have a trip to London for a night and two days and am excited to go! I mean I paid for a bus and train and hostel.

I paid to experience Jeff Wayne's War of the World's immersive experience which I've wanted to do for a while. Entry into comic con the next day along with a diamond pass to meet Noah Schnapp who I'd love to meet and respect

  
I'm excited as hell! And yet I feel anxious as hell too  
I got a little overwhelmed today. I was out running some errands. I want to give Noah a letter along with a gift for him and a card and set of smaller gifts for him and his costars. A set of bookmarks. I want to put them together and write a handwritten version of the letter and I yet I keep procrastinating. I cant keep thinking ""what if the letter is too much or too long or too boring? What if the bookmarks suck? (Half of them turned out wrong. 2 were smudged and 1 was cut off at least 3 seemed to come out decent). What if my clothes stink and I bother people at the con? Or at the immersive experience? 

Anyway I was running around town. I had to go to a print shop today to print out the letter and the designs since my printer is broken. And I for whatever reason found it so difficult to actually enter the shop and talk to the empoyees. I went to the shop after and felt so out of place. Im stumbling around tripping over my own feet. Can't find the women's deodorant (Im trans mtf but in the closet and boymode cause my family aren't the most accepting and I have no idea how I'm gonna share it) so I'm going back and forth in the isles, convinced everyone is staring at me wondering why ""a boy"" is in the women's section or that im shoplifting when I have to leave without buying anything because this shop didnt have the deodorant I like.

I often get like this around crowds of people. I walk very fast and am always zig zagging through crowds but I feel like im being an asshole by cutting people off without meaning too. Not just on foot either. Just today while driving I accidentally cut another car off because I had a thousand thoughts and didn't process them in time. Then I felt so bad and so anxious when they were driving behind me after.

Turns out they weren't following me  
I have so many anxious worries. Like what if my tickets are wrong. What if I cant get into the immersive experience. What if they lose my bags. What are the showers at the hostel gonna be like? What if I can't sleep? What if I miss my train home?  
It's ridiculous! I've traveled by myself for the first time last march. That was a 9 hour flight and 2 weeks away from home with no one nearby. I was shitting my pants then but the whole trip was fine. Why am I still feeling this way?

278226585,reddit,offmychest,1763242902,"I’m deeply turned on by older women — trying to understand why

Hey everyone,
I(29) have noticed that I’m especially turned on by older women — sometimes much older, even in their 60s or 70s. It’s not just physical, though I do find the natural signs of aging (wrinkles, fuller bodies, etc.) attractive. There’s also this emotional element — a kind of warmth, maturity, and confidence that really gets to me.

At the same time, I’ve realized that part of what turns me on is the idea of recognition or approval — like I’d love to feel that I’m desired or appreciated by someone experienced and confident. It feels both comforting and arousing.

I’m not judging myself for it, but I do wonder what drives this kind of attraction psychologically. Is it about emotional validation? A subconscious association from childhood experiences? Or just a natural preference like any other?

I’d really love to hear if anyone else has felt something similar, or if you’ve ever explored where it comes from for you.

From ages 12 to 15, i grew up on the internet, no monitorisation.

I always used to text multiple random men around the same time, it wasnt always multiple.

 That ranged from mid twenties to forties on the internet on snap, discord and omegle, to get compliments, attention that my family never gave me because theyre emotionally unavailable and emotionally abusive and neglectful, i also wanted to feel love, i knew it was wrong but i always kept doing it as a release because i never had anyone else and it became the normal for me.

  i never really showed them any pics of myself, only like half my face at the least, they always pressured me to send pics or to say things to them, which i did the latter, when it got too serious or if they kept pressuring me constantly i would either ignore them untill i blocked them.

i would also usually block them if they kept sending me unwanted pics or if they kept bugging me after saying no to sexual conversations.

 i would flirt back at times or play along to sexting even though i felt disgust and other emotions, i ignored all of them and put it in the back of my head.

 All of this has come to haunt me now as im 19, i wish none of it happened and that i didnt do these stupid things, it messed up my morals and knowing what normalcy is supposed to be like, which ive only just in the 3/2 years learned  whats right and what isnt

In this year around June my cat died. And for some reason it seems silly how hung up on her I am but she meant everything to me.

And no matter what she would seek me out for naps as a kitten to the point I started carrying her around in my hood and she loved it. As she grew up out bind grew stronger we'd play together, shed eat meals with me and despite having her own food demanded mine which if it was OK for cats to have I gave in. Wed stay up late together talking and I swear shed actually respond with her well timed meows. She cuddled up with me whenever I sat down for too long or played videos games. She was the only good in my life. But unfortunately.... 2 weeks before her birthday she went m.i.a... and I got worried put up posts on everything I could think of. I eventually got a response from the in town animal shelter saying a cat matched her description. When I got there I was informed the cat was dead and when I went to go look it was her. I felt like my heart just stopped and exploded. This isn't the first death I've experienced but this is the only one that hurts so much. I'm not sure what to do.

408955835,reddit,offmychest,1764133289,"My first ""boy""friend was a 32 year old man. I was 15.

I want to tell the story of my first boyfriend. If you could call him that. We met when I was 15, I lost my virginity to this man when I was 16, and we stayed together till I was 18, when I pulled the threads and unraveled it all. He called himself MG. His parents named him Matthew. He was a 32 year old man posing as a 22 year old college student. He worked at a shitty retail job and lived in a shitty rented house, so it was kind of believable if you ignored the crow's feet. He fooled me, he fooled my mom by doing whatever manipulators do to get people to believe their lies. Charm and deflect.

Our first date was to the movies. I remember making out for the 3rd time ever in my life. The intensity of this man was scary but also exciting? I think I was 16 at this point. I'm sure he was aware that I was past some kind of threshold. 15 was too young, a child.

I lost my virginity to this man in February of 2002, at his house. He liked to have me over once a week or every other week to hang out. I thought this was a normal thing, the way relationships work. He would put on a movie or a show, we'd laugh, smoke weed, laugh some more, go upstairs.

Things went on this way for about two years. Casual statutory rape. Along with the Big Lie about his age, there were more lies than I can remember, but I'll try. One that I remember was a night that he didn't come over. No call, no show, missed our date. I cried myself to sleep. He called me the next day and said that there was an incident at the club he had been working at the night before. He claimed that everyone in the club had passed out and woke up in a daze, no idea what happened. He lied about having sisters. He called them Belinda and Betina, and showed me a cut out from City Paper, claiming the model was one of his sisters. I did not get the Muppets reference at the time, but I do now (they are the names of twin Muppets). He has no sisters. He is an only child. He claimed to study Astroradiology at Villanova University. He claimed to work in cybersecurity at a bank. I believed him despite looking for an “Astroradiology” program at Villanova and coming up blank. And why would anyone work in retail after a career in cybersecurity.

It started to unravel when I turned 18. The red flags I had been too young to see were starting to creep into view, until they were all I could see. My friends were increasingly concerned about me. He canceled dates. I noticed a red car parked in his driveway several nights a week. This was not a roommate’s car. I knew what was happening, and I knew that I had to address the creeping feeling that he had been a liar from day one.

Yes, I had suspicions the whole time. Our whole “relationship”. I had asked to see his driver’s license several times, mostly playfully, but I did want to see his birthday. Something deep inside me knew but didn’t want to know. Now I wanted to know. It was 2004, the internet was not what it is today but we did have the MySpace and The White Pages. I used the White Pages site to run his name and saw the results. He was 36 years old. I was 18. My reaction was immediate. I was disgusted, so angry, murderously angry at how he’d HAD me. PLAYED me so hard. I could not realize at the time the immense damage he did, but I knew that something very bad had happened to me. I called him, I screamed at him, and cut him off forever.

Just kidding! I did call him and scream at him. He requested that we meet. I agreed. That’s when things got really weird. He claimed various things. Clerical error. Decade long coma. Aliens. Yes, aliens.

It was too sad to listen to. Even at that point I still couldn’t believe that someone could lie, and lie, and lie, and lie… ad infinitum. But I cut it off and left for good.

Just kidding again. I did cut it off. But over the years (it has been over 20 years) I have found myself in his orbit at various times, and feeling pity, feelings of sentimentality when remembering the handful of good times. Most recently, I went on a forgiveness quest during the pandemic. I reached out when I saw a mutual friend who said that he “talked about \[me\] all the time”. I still didn’t know what to do with all of the feelings I had about him. How could someone who was undoubtedly a shitty boyfriend but was also funny and witty be a monster. Was he even a monster? Could I even trust myself? Maybe I could heal myself by replacing all the bad memories with good ones? Maybe it wasn’t that bad after all?

What finally, finally, finally pulled me out was, of all things, was Evan Rachel Wood’s accounting of her relationship with Marilyn Manson. I saw myself in her, this young, beautiful girl with a manipulative old creep. The Me Too stories started pouring out of people. Most recently, the emphasis on the Epstein files have triggered memories and helped me find my rage. With that white hot rage, I severed the trauma bond and banished him to hell. I hope he fucking burns.

Epilogue: I’m married to a beautiful, honest man, we have two beautiful kids, life is wonderful. I’m a hospice nurse. I haven’t lost my faith in humanity. Not even close. And my mom is my best friend. I forgave her for her mistake, and she finally forgave herself.

I wrote this for me, and for anyone who might relate to my story. I hope it helps someone :) I felt a lot of shame and embarrassment for a long time, which makes me sad for my younger self. Now at nearly 40, with friends and family members who have 15 year old children, I realize how very young and innocent I was. After some time in therapy, I realized how trauma works, and that trauma bonds are very real, powerful, and very confusing feelings to deal with. None of the shame or embarrassment was ever mine, I didn't do anything to earn it. He did. If you relate to this and you're still feeling those feelings, it's not yours either &lt;3",0.47886392,0.40243408,0.10221587,0

Ngayon, nag ttext sila na i settle na daw ung kalahati. Wala na akong pera pambayad kasi akala ko okay naman sa kanila kasi if hindi, nangungulit naman sila araw araw.

This might be me having a mini crash out but as a 30 year old F that never gets any M attention and has never been asked out in person, I am exhausted! It's really messing with my self-worth. I've done all the self-help and self-care rituals to boost my self-esteem, explored different scenery to increase my chances of being seen, involved myself in different hobbies but I've never been approached. I've witnessed countless times friends and sisters get approached and pursued, and it's kind of disheartening that it's never happened for me. My sisters say it's because I have a negative aura, I'm not approachable, I have a RBF etc. but then contradict it by saying I'm too nice and bubbly. I've witnessed others that are unapproachable get approached; it just feels like it happens for everyone else excluding me. The only dates I've been on was when I was in HI, I had downloaded the apps and it just feels like everyone gets with whoever over there, and most on the app are military (nothing wrong with that but most of them are cheating husbands or just wanting HU).

137590196,reddit,offmychest,1762256721,"I’ve hurt my friends really bad, but I can’t bring myself to care. And I don’t know how to fix it.

Over the weekend I made two of my friends really mad, one of them so bad that they’re refusing to talk to me. The other one told me I needed to apologise and so I did but it just made things worse because they felt like I wasn’t being genuine. I value our friendship a lot. They’re genuinely some of the best friends I’ve ever had but I don’t know how to apologise because I just don’t care. I understand that what I was doing was annoying, but I don’t think it’s worthy of never speaking to me again and I’m struggling to take it seriously because I don’t understand why they’re so mad. I’m torn between desperately wanting to fix this but struggling to figure out how because I can’t figure out how to take it seriously.

For context these two friends have been semi flirting for the past few weeks and on the weekend I made too many jokes about it and apparently made them both uncomfortable. I had no idea they felt this way until the next morning when one of them asked me to apologise. 

I think at first we all wanted to reconcile but since my lack lustre apology, I’ve been told that my lack of care for hurting others is really disturbing, which hurt me a lot to hear but I just don’t know how to take the situation seriously because it’s so dumb in my mind. 
I don’t understand how a few uncomfortable jokes warrant all of this anger and if it was that bad, why didn’t they tell me sooner? 

I feel guilty that I’ve hurt them and I really want us to all be friends again, but I don’t know how. The first apology was so bad that our mutual friends asked me if I’ve ever apologised to anyone before and honestly the answer is no. I’ve never been in a situation like this where I’ve had to apologise so earnestly and even though I feel bad I don’t know how to take myself seriously enough to do it. I’m a very jokey lighthearted person and I don’t think I’ve ever been in a situation where I’ve hurt someone this badly. 

I can feel the ship burning around me, but I can’t bring myself to leave or try and save anyone or really do anything. I recognise that I’ve hurt my friends really badly and that I fucked up but every time I try and type out an apology or I practice talking about it my face is blank and my voice is robotic and I can’t hide the fact that I don’t care. I just don’t understand it and I don’t know how to understand it. 

But on the flipside, I do really care and I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s made me so sad I can’t bring myself to smile or laugh and my family and other friends are starting to notice something is wrong because it’s put me in such a bad mood.

367906022,reddit,offmychest,1763842368,"I'm finally planning on date !

The day that i'm planning is Janyary 2nd, the day where i want to die, i've been feeling suicidal and depressed for a few years now but i never really planned it i was always afraid to do it, and doing it spontaneously is too much of a hassle as i don't want to leave any unfinished business.

At this moment i'm doing an internship and still have work left to do  even though my mood swings and depressive thoughts are quiet strong i still very much enjoy my time in the company and want to finish the current project before doing anything reckless which puts January 2nd as the perfect date, i would have finished my internships so i won't feel like i left unfinished business, since january 1st is a holiday it gives me enough time to clean my whole appartment, wash all my clothes and get rid of all the food in the house, i don't know exactly when my body will be found as i live alone and have no friends or relative who lives in my city and i doubt any of them have my current adress as i moved here temporarily just to do my internship so i don't want to leave a mess behind and have my familly burdened with cleaning after a dead body.

I still don't know exactly how i will do it, i'm wondering if meds will do the trick but i don't know if i have the lethal dose required, because of some previous health issues i've been prescribed some very strong drugs but it might just get me sick and have me throw up or just get me hospitalized so i really want to be careful about it. I don't really want to cut my vains as i don't like being in pain even if the sight of blood is very beautiful (i know my self and i know i would probably start a painting with my blood because of how beautiful the color is) plus if i fail this attempt i would be left with a mess to clean and scars on my hand i don't really like the idea of living with a damaged body plus it might just bring me unwanted attention because if i fail it would mean that somebody stopped and thus my family would get to know about it and i would have to live with shame afterwards and constanlty being reminded about it everytime i glance at my wrists, plus i mean my family never even bother asking me how i feel and just start making things about themselves when i try to reach out so if they know it ir see the scars it will be a real hassle to deal with.

I'm still obviously very scared about but soo existed about it, i still have some things left to do before i leave, i'm thinking of donating part of my clothes, i'm not sure if i want to sell my electronics or just give them away i mean i won't need to money afterwards i already sorted out most of my legal documents the only thing left is my appartemnt which i don't know when exactly i should end the lease maybe a week or 2 after ? I mean will anyone even get my deposit back or will it be canceled because of my dead body ? I will obviously leave my nody in my current appartment even if i technically could dig my own grave in a remote place but it would make it risky if a person found me before i definitly leave and calls an ambulance.

I still have a lot of things to figure out and deal with but i think a month and half will be enough and if i happen to fail i would have to wait till mid july so i can at least finish the semester i have left in college and graduate properly (the semester starts on january 5th so might as well go with it)",0.25462922,0.047349896,0.030691283,0

I seriously don't know what to do with myself.

I've been making steady progress for over a year after experiencing severe burn out. Tried exercising, eating healthy, meditating and journaling. It did help but somehow I'd still feel so lost. I no longer find enjoyment in anything that I do.

The only thing that keeps me going is the scholarship and the realization that I don't have any safety net if I dropped out. I'm from a poor but humble family. My father has always been very supportive on what I do but I don't know, I can't seem to figure out how to get out of this mess.

I’ve been trying so hard to keep myself busy to stay focused on my studies, to not let my mind drift into that loop of thoughts  but somehow it still does.

While everything feels so good when we talk, it’s the silence in between that kills me. It’s like I’m fine one moment and the next, my chest feels heavy for no clear reason. Sometimes I try to name it maybe it’s anxiety, maybe jealousy or maybe just plain longing but I can’t really tell.

I hate admitting this but sometimes I get jealous of his freedom like how he can just go out, have fun, travel and live while I’m stuck here trying to focus on my goals, drowning in overthinking. It’s not like I want to control him or anything i just wish I didn’t feel so small and left out when he’s out there living.

I keep telling myself to focus on my life, my dreams and studies, and most days I really do but there are times when I can’t shake it off  that sinking feeling that I’m being left behind in a life I desperately want to be a part of.

I've felt this way since I was 14y, it took me a while to get help and to be medicated, it's been currently 5 years I think of being on meds. helped a lot. it got easier to do things, to live, to breathe, but I still feel suicidal sometimes, and I often have days where I feel like shit and its like what I've felt when I was younger but i manage to get back. the thing is it's that this feelings doesn't ever go away it just stays asleep for a while but it's always there. I just don't want to get of meds if I don't know if I'll be capable of bounce back. so the question is there's a way to know if your brain works or not? if it's chemical or just something that happened that I didn't deal with yet?

haven't taken professional tests yet, but i first identified myself as likely depressed in like January or something. long story short, it got better in August but worsened again, but not as bad. but for whatever reason i kinda wanted to get back to that state of depression before. sometimes I'm even actively trying to do stuff to make myself more depressed.
background: extremely introverted and probably have autism
the thing is I'm pretty unpopular at school, and i feel like people just keep talking about me behind me, which just makes me so insecure
i don't even have a single friend or someone i trust that i can talk to (trust is the biggest issue i have i think)
tbh i feel safer talking to strangers than to people i know 
also pretty much have zero work motivation and procrastinates a lot, to the point that I'm completing homework the few hours before the lesson (exactly what I'm doing right now when I'm writing this)
which fuelled my anxiety, a lot
i often find my thoughts drifting to s/icide recently &gt;!i have easy access to high spots!&lt;
literally the only thing holding me together right now is the thought that there is something significant that I *can* do in the future to at least make myself survive, while I can't even motivate myself to do my homework and just me being such a utter piece of trash
it's kinda hard to explain this thought
like, it's kinda like fantasising about stuff actually, i can't find the right word to describe it, maybe just ignore this part
anyways
i've been doing absolutely nothing productive or meaningful to try to make my depression less worse, i'm pretty much just find reasons to persuade myself to kill myself right now

1067794,reddit,offmychest,1761132801,"I feel like I’ve completely lost myself and I don’t know how to get through the days anymore

I’m 23 years old and I work remotely. I spend most of my days alone at home, just me and my laptop. I’m usually the quiet, introverted type — I don’t go out much, and I’ve always valued a few deep connections over a big circle of friends. For the past few years, I had that one person — my best friend. We used to talk every day about everything, from random things to our deepest thoughts. She knew me better than anyone.

But about three weeks ago, I did something really stupid. Out of panic and overthinking, I ended up breaking her trust. I told someone close to her something she had once shared with me privately. I didn’t mean any harm, but it hurt her badly — and honestly, I get why. Since that day, she’s cut me off completely. She blocked me everywhere, and even though I’ve apologized so many times, she doesn’t want to hear from me again. I know I was wrong, but I also feel like it’s not something so unforgivable that I can’t even get the chance to make it right. Still, I can’t change what’s done.

It’s been 22 days now, and I’ve never felt this low. My phone barely lights up anymore — no notifications, no messages, no one to talk to. I deleted Instagram and Snapchat because seeing them just reminds me of her. I still check her name sometimes, even though I know I’m blocked everywhere. I barely eat, sometimes order food even when something’s already cooked, and I just lie down for hours doing nothing. Even when I sleep, I dream about her — about things being okay again — and when I wake up, it all hits me again.

I’m not suicidal, but there are moments when I wish something would just happen — like a crash or an accident — not because I want to die, but because I don’t want to keep feeling like this. The silence in my room is deafening. From 6 p.m. till late at night, I just sit staring at walls or random YouTube videos, trying to kill time. My only friend who stays with me gets home around 11, but I can’t keep telling him how I feel — I’m tired of hearing myself say the same things too.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this — maybe because I just want to feel heard. I’m not looking for pity, I just want to talk. Maybe with someone who’s been through something similar, or someone who knows what it’s like to lose a connection that meant everything. I just need a reminder that things will
go well in the end. The crux is I don’t want to lose her.",0.081625134,0.020579277,0.01274247,0

119944859,reddit,offmychest,1762115726,"Been homeless for 4 months due to narcissistic parents and struggling to carry on

I don't even know where to start. This story is so complicated.

In April i lost my job. I couldn't find another one fast enough and I ended up losing my apartment

During this time, my mother and father came to talk to me about what I could do. But the conversation devolved, as it always does, into an argument about the past. 

You see, i was sexually abused as a minor by my mum's brother. When it all came out when I was 18 (now 34) my mother essentially made the whole thing about herself. About how she was betrayed by her brother and all the pain she was going through. To be blunt it's highly likely she is a narcissist. She has always been emotionally and physically abusive. Not just to me but my sisters too. 

If this wasn't bad enough, my mum ended up blaming me for my sexual abuse, stating ""it takes two to tango"" which essentially destroyed our relationship. And instead of realising the horrific thing she had done and make amends, has instead opted to turn herself into the victim whenever held to account on this issue.

Fast forward to being 34 and losing my apartment. Me and my mother are still arguing. She's always wondering why i still hold resentment towards her or why i don't call etc. Which forces me to bring up past incidents that have never been healed. 

We're having this same argument again but with the backdrop that I'm on the verge of homelessness. 

She turns to me during this and says ""You're not a victim. When i was 14 and started having sex, i knew exactly what I was doing"" which is just one of the nastiest things to say to anyone that's been molested.

So the next day after trying to ask for support from my sister (she refused) i tried to kill myself. 

I took a lot of painkillers and alcohol in a very short space of time. Luckily my family arrived and I was rushed to hospital where I was luckily saved. 

Upon coming out of hospital, the family rallied around, seemingly like a wake up call had been issued, and we devised a plan. I would move in with my parents and go back to college to train up in a trade and get back on my feet. 

Unfortunately, this didn't work out. 

Over the weeks of moving my stuff in, my mum started her old tricks with me and began starting arguments. She was particularly concerned that I still felt animosity towards her (i did), but wouldn't acknowledge why that was or give it time to heal. She expected everything to be fine with her within a week of me coming out of the hospital. 

We had some pretty big arguments. But eventually i managed to move in there after some efforts from my sister to be diplomatic. 

But within days of being there my mum just seemed to lose her shit. 

I watched the exorcist with my 19 year old sister. She's getting older and i felt she needed to learn more adult themes. But also the movie is close to my heart because the implication of the daughters possession in that movie is that she's being sexually abused. So, i was attempting to use the movie so that she could perhaps understand me better as a person. 

Halfway through my mother barges in and see's what we're watching and starts yelling about it. Says that my sister will have nightmares etc. I don't rise to the bait and stay pretty calm but my mum doesn't like that and says ""you're trying to corrupt your sister the same way your uncle corrupted you"" which is just so insanely hurtful and disgusting to imply.

A few days go by and I need to pick up a TV. I have to ask her to help me pick it up. She agrees.

While in the car she begins an argument with me again. But this time i recorded it. My mum was being way more unhinged than normal so i knew something was going to go down. 

Basically the argument devolved. I stayed pretty calm, but it was difficult. By the end my mum was screaming and threatening me. She threatened to get my dad to attack me. 

And that's exactly what happened. My dad came out to the garden, i took a video of the entire incident. He took a big caravan plug and began hitting me across the head and body with the plug-end of it. Probably about 5 times. 

We then broke apart and he approaches me again. I warned him if he touched me again I'd have to defend myself (i said it less politely than that). But he took this as an invitation and started punching me. 

I fell and he got ontop of me and started punching me in the head. I got up off the floor, and got some distance, and then I started hitting back. And they really didn't like that.

I hit my dad pretty hard and he fell to the floor crying and then ran into the house saying he was getting the police. 

I also phoned the police and they arrived around 10 minutes after. 

I showed the officer my video but despite the evidence, i was still arrested and i became the suspect in the crime. 

This arrest and the bail conditions are what caused my homelessness. 

I stayed with my sister for a month or so but it wasn't sustainable. So I had to go to the government and they gave me temporary accommodation at a homeless shelter. And I've been here ever since. 

But i stuck to my plan. I'm in college, I'm one of the top of the class of joinery and tiling. And I'm doing well in that respect.

But everything around me is just making it harder. I can't find work. Welfare is very low here so money is very tight. I can't have visitors so barely see friends. 

I've tried to date but every time it feels like it's going good, the rug gets pulled from me suddenly. 

The atmosphere in the shelter is so off, because i think it's primarily used for criminals just out of prison and you never really know what they did. So you can't trust anyone. People have mental episodes here and someone tried to kill themselves by jumping out of a window about a month ago.

Despite money, i took a break and visited a friend for a couple days. Honestly it felt so good to just be able to relax and be with familiar people I can trust. But when I came back on the train it hit me so hard. I just didn't want to go back. The thought of going from friends, trust and love. Back to hopelessness, pain and anxiety was making me sick. I burst into tears on the train. 

I have my court hearing on the 17th. I'm anxious about it but i believe I can win. Not only do I have the video recording of the attack against me, i filed a data request of my arrest with all bodycam footage. In the bodycam footage, the officer that arrested me goes to speak to my parents. During this, my father actually admits to attacking me in both instances. However the police officer tries to talk over him. But it's clear as day. 

So I'm fairly certain i can win this. My entire future rests on it. If i lose here, getting work and getting out of being homeless will basically be impossible. My life will be ruined forever 

I just wish I could catch a break. I need something good in my life to give me hope",0.3375374,0.24928534,0.053399716,0

Throughout my entire life I’ve always been good at whatever new endeavors I began. Mostly physical and artistic activities. I was an amazing gymnast, cheerleader, runner, and CrossFit-er in my youth. Eventually I became a certified yoga teacher and taught for a year. Then I became a contortionist, aerialist, painter, hula hooper, skater, swimmer, sculptor, dancer, the list goes on. I’ve done a tremendous amount of things in my life so far, but I’ve never stuck with any of it. As the seasons of my life changed and my schedules got interrupted, Id fall off my routine and eventually stop doing whatever hobby/passion I was engulfed in at the time. For a while it didn’t bother me because I was young and always on the precipice of something new to dedicate myself to. As I’ve gotten older though, I find myself feeling lost and unsatisfied with all of things I’ve left behind. I look at people in specific fields who have never wavered from their path and have built wonderful and fulfilling careers/lives for themselves from their passions. And all I have to show for myself are a bunch of participation trophies. I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve done but nothing has stuck with my soul enough to inspire me to stick with it as the seasons change. I truly feel like a jack of all trades, master of none. I try to see the silver lining, that I’ve gotten to experience such a diverse range of paths, but I am so upset that I don’t have even one mastered passion/hobby in my book. It’s hard to get back into certain things after taking such a long hiatus and having to essentially start over zaps my excitement about trying it again. So I’ve kept myself in a loop of starting something new and abandoning it after sometime. I don’t even know why I do it. I wouldn’t consider myself a quitter or weak but perhaps an all or nothing mindset has corroded my ability to stay consistent. I feel like a loser. I am currently in school for a career that will give me freedom financially and won’t swallow up all of my time, but it’s not a passion. I dont want to wake up 10 years from now and only have my job be the one thing I’ve truly devoted myself to. I want a vibrant life where i work my job as everyone needs to, but I also have a successful and flourishing passion that I dedicate myself to outside of work. I wish I had just one thing that spoke to my soul enough that I continue to get better and better despite things disrupting my consistency.",0.039462693,0.022255141,0.0040512653,0

I hate her so much, she did such shitty things.

hurting the ones she loved by venting all the time when things bothered her, jokingly hitting people when it was a joke, stupidly leaving a bite mark on her BEST FRIEND, just bc they scared her over something i don’t even remember anymore.

WHY WAS ME FROM 11-14 SUCH A FUCKING DUMBASS, I ENDED UP GETTING GODDAMN GROOMED WHEN I WAS 13 BC I STUPIDLY SOMEWHAT (not really, basically forced myself) INTO LOVING A GUY (who is best friends with my sisters boyfriend) AND HE DID ALL THIS STUPID STUFF TO ME AND SAID INAPPROPRIATE THINGS TO ME (he was 15 when i was 13) AND HE KISSED THE TOP OF MY HEAD ONCE WITHOUT PERMISSION.

I HATE YOUNGER ME AND HOW STUPID SHE WAS, SHE FUCKED UP EVERY GOOD THING I HAD AND NOW ME CURRENTLY HAS TO DEAL WITH THE PAIN AND THE BURDEN AND THEN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BC OF HER.

AND FOR WHAT, WHAT WAS THE POINT OF ALL THE FUCKING SHIT THAT HAPPENED TO ME, EVERY DAY MY LIFE JUST GETS WORSE ANYWAYS, YEAH SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF MY LIFE BUT MY BEST FRIEND IS STILL AROUND AND I CONSTANTLY FEEL LIKE THE WORST FUCKING FRIEND TO HIM BC OF WHAT YOUNGER ME DID.

I HAVE CHANGED BUT THAT DOESNT CHANGE THE FACT I STILL DID WHAT I DID AND IM SO FUCKING SORRY AND I FEEL SO SHIT ABOUT IT. 

I wish he (my bsf) would just abandon me so my thoughts become reality, and then i can die, bc im literally only here still bc i love him and would never leave him bc i atleast wanna try to make it to both our 21st birthdays, but its such a shit deal i have to put up with id rather him be okay without me than me keep hurting him like i ALWAYS KEEP MANAGING TO FUCKING DO.

But i dont want him to abandon me, i need him to be here for me, hes my only support, my parents dont give a shit about me, and i have so much hurt on my chest i need to tell him about so hes aware of some of it but i never know a good time.

he has better friends than me, what is the fucking point of me being around bc we hardly talk anymore as is even tho im pretty sure its bc hes busy with school but i never know for sure and i feel abandoned regardless, to the point i dont reach out hardly anymore unless he does first bc if im annoying ill get abandoned again. I always do.

My own family fucking hates me bc im annoying, my stupid vocal stims, and my sister fucking abuses me and i have NO ONE to talk to about it.

Bc im already a burden as is why make it worse.

I want to die, i just am trapped. Suffocating even, but still here. Im numb i cant fucking cry, so i take it out physically, i don’t fucking know the point of me being here anymore.

Yoynger me FUCKED over my life and No matter what me now does it will never change the fact of what has happened to me. Ill still have the trauma &amp; memories &amp; guilt. And i deserve nothing and should die.

Im telling people to not get me anything for Christmas i dont fucking deserve it, and i have no money for buying anyone anything anyways and my mom wont let me get a job.

190222921,reddit,Anxiety,1762637212,"Anxiety about random door knocking for painting work

My large apartment complex has a manager who's awful at communication. In early October they left notices on every door saying starting that weekend and going forward, on a Saturday or Sunday someone would come to paint the inside of our front door.  Except there was no time frame given or indication which section they're starting with.  And it said if you weren't home, they'd come back another time.  

So for the last month, I've been strangely on edge about this. When I hear someone come up the stairs, I get nervous. There's been crews doing outside maintenance around the complex, but so far I don't think anyone has shown up and it's been a month.  I asked the manager about times and they didn't reply. 

I've had 2 dreams now where I woke up early in the morning, today it was around 7 AM, because I swore I heard someone knocking, and it was Saturday.  But no one was there.  

And I'm venting because it's ridiculous to expect someone to just be available randomly on a weekend!  I also should mention that after the door painting, you're supposed to keep your door open for 45 minutes, too, so I'd have to hang out near the front door.

I haven't stayed home waiting though all the time, I take walks and I'm not giving up prime autumn leaf viewing time to wait on random painters.",0.11739369,0.06889887,0.004994711,0

434092810,reddit,offmychest,1764283292,"I’m realizing it wasn’t the action that hurt me..it was the broken principle. How do I heal from that?

So last weekend my girlfriend was in a beauty pageant. Before the event, she and I talked about boundaries  specifically about keeping a bit of distance from one of the male contestants. She was the one who said, “Don’t worry, there won’t be any touching or closeness.”

Cool. I trusted that. Not because I thought she’d do something wild, but because she made the boundary herself and we agreed on it.

But during the event, she ended up touching him anyway .. nothing intimate, nothing scandalous. Just… something she clearly said wouldn’t happen.

And the weird part is, I’m not actually upset about the physical thing. The action itself was small and honestly meaningless. What’s been eating at me is the principle behind it ,,, the fact that she confidently set a line and then crossed it like it didn’t matter.( She said the judges forced her into doing it in her defense, that was before she apologized)

It made me feel like our agreements don’t hold the same weight for her as they do for me.

I’m not accusing her of cheating. I’m not trying to control her. I just feel this heavy crack in trust, and it’s messing with my head more than I expected. I keep thinking, “If something so small can be dismissed due to pressure from people, what about bigger things later?”

So what I'm asking is how do you heal from a situation where the hurt isn’t about what happened, but what it meant?
How do you rebuild trust when the principle matters more than the moment?
And how do you work through that without becoming bitter or overly sensitive?",0.09308127,0.026702631,0.010507392,0

*PS: I live in the Philippines*  
  
Hey, so in quarantine, when I was about 14/15, I was in a very depressive state to the point that I crashed out on my family, and tbh, idk what happened anymore at that time because my mind kinda blocked it cause it was very traumatic for me. Now I'm 18 and I don't think that feeling went away.   
  
I was severely bullied when I was about 8-11 years old, resulting in me having very low self-esteem, but I've always tried to be better (despite my doing SH in many ways). I recently relapsed because now that I'm in univ, I feel like I'm the dumbest person among my friends. Although they never made me feel that way, I think it's my insecurity about my knowledge. I've always been very aware that I'm not mentally okay, and I would like to tell my mom what's been happening so she could appoint me to a psychiatrist because I've always been confused and ik that something is wrong with me. I just don't want to self-diagnose anything because I know that it's not healthy. 

I almost ended my life like 2 times this month, and I'm giving myself a last push of hope, and if it doesn't work and I still feel like this, I'll end it.   
This is why I wanted to tell my mom. Although we have a healthcare card, we're still not very comfortable financially. I would love to take some suggestions and advice from anyone who's experienced this as well. I'm still contemplating whether I should tell my mom or not because I really dont want to be a burden.

We're supposed to get married next Friday and she's hit me out of nowhere that she doesn't want to get married anymore.

My (M29) fiancée (F27) keeps saying that I'm an alcoholic even though I'm not. I mean I'll drink a 6 pack after work. Or a couple of them weekend days when I don't work. But I don't drink anything other than beer. I don't get violent or go out starting fights. I hold down a job and make sure my bills are paid. For about the last year my fiancée insists that I'm an alcoholic though. A lot of the time she'll say I'm drunk and that it is obvious to everyone even though I think I'm hiding it. But I'm not hiding anything because I'm not drunk. She has complained about my hygiene even though I shower and wear clean clothes daily same as I always have. She has also said she misses how I was when we first met even though nothing else has changed except that I enjoy beer now. I'm not abusing her or getting drunk or anything like that but she won't let go of the idea that I'm an alcoholic.

She says she wants to call off the wedding, and she's given me an ultimatum that I need to give up alcohol and see a counsellor about my drinking or she's leaving. We had a big argument about this a month ago and it was so bad that she left our flat and went to stay with her brother that night.

84886473,reddit,offmychest,1761843232,"my relationship was a rollercoaster of emotions and after everything we got thru together she broke up with me and got with her ex

so this is gonna be a long one so bare with me here 

it all started when me 21M became friends with this girl 21F lets call lisa(fake name), we started talking and going out with a group of 4 ppl all were girls, one of the girls there we'll call maria, we studied all together in the same uni and hung out occasionally other than sitting together between classes so it all started near the end of the semester, lisa has strict parents who dont let her go out for no reason or see guys but when the semester ended she told her parents there were still 2 weeks left of studies so she can hang out only issue is that meant she has to get out the house at 8am and return near 3pm everyday and the other girls couldnt do that so i did and it became a thing of us hanging out everyday going to restaurants beaches museums and the works and there was a tiny bit of flirting here and there holding hands ""platonically"" and all and then one day we were sitting by the beach and i wanted to tell her i liked her but wasnt sure so i wrote her a long paragraph and sent it to her and let her read it and after she was done she said she liked me too and it was great and all and we went back home holding hands and smiling happy laughing and joking that the other 2 girls would kill us then we skip to when i got home maria the girl from the group texted me saying some mean stuff like ur just a man after all and u betrayed me and all and apparently she felt like our group was gonna be ruined cuz we started dating and sshe was borderline psycothic then me and lisa talked and saw that the only way that things were gonna go back to normal is if we pretend that didnt happen and remain friends so we broke up and immediately after that maria started telling lisa that she loved her for the longest time and she was so happy i didnt steal her and that she felt so betrayed cuz i apparently knew maria liked lisa which was not the case at all and i quote she said ""thank you for breaking up with him for me and sorry not sorry and ill never be "" but couldnt stop us from being romantic with eachother so we ultimately decided that we would get back together and drop the other 2 girls and for a ehile it was nice being with her only thing is they were the only decent ppl in her class and i didnt have any classes with her so she was alone in them all and after a while maria came to lisa apologizing and telling her she supports us and to please give her another chance so lisa let the decision up to me which i said okay cuz i knew she was suffering from being isolated in the only place she had friends cuz things were rough at home for her now skip forward a few weeks lisa started to get cold and avoidant with me and i told her is maria telling you anything about me she kept denying it so i believed her and one day she sat me down and told me ahe wants a break up to which i just kinda said okay in a blurr and then we just stayed friends and talked and called sometimes and once she gave me access to her pc to help her run a program on it so i did fix it and while doing so i knew she used chat gpt a lot so i put that extension for her on opera and accidentally clicked on it and the first convo that pops up was ""OP and maria story"" so i got curious and i started reading and i was horrified it was just dozens of paragraphs talking about me and about her situation so apparently maria has been telling her all sorts of things to get her to break up with me ranging from i only buy her gifts cuz ik she doesnt love me to other things that are bad anyways then i get to the part where she talked about me like i was a horrible person saying i smoke and i do stuff and all in a really bad light and after that i see maria confessing to to lisa again and lisa telling her ""give me time to break up with him"" which she ultimately did and when lisa came back and i confronted her she got super defensive and dismissive of the situation so i just left and after that she texted me a long paragraph about how sorry she was and how much of a bad person she is and how i must think shes horrible so i said ik not ready to talk we will tomorrow, a few hours later she texts me saying she cant wait and knows im in so much pain and all and proceeded to apologize over and over again and explain the situation and asking for forgiveness and i considered it after that she said she didnt wanna lose me ever again not as a friend but as the love of her life and shes ready to cuz them off and never talk to them again which kinda made me think i might do it and after thinking i decided to forgive her and leave it in the passed then after that by a week she told me she was having a bad day and was on her period and i was home that day and i didnt have any classes so i decided to go and suprise her eith snacks and drinks and as soon as i get to uni i wait a bit and then when she was supposed to get out i call her a few times and i get no answer so i just went outside of uni to wait for her and the first time i see was lisa walking with maria laughing together i went there and maria just dipped after seeing me not before giving lisa a hug which just added fuel to the fire and after that i sat her down and told her i avoided making you choose but this has gotten too far now look its either me or her and there no going back on that and she said me and told her to never talk to her again or contact her skip forward 3 months and she breaks up with me out of no where again saying she feels overwhelmed by our relationship cuz she cant give me what i need which mind you i just wanted to text at least more than 5 mins per day i was barely getting any time with her so i told her look im not gonna talk to u for the next 5 days get ur shit back together and tell me if u want us or no she said okay and i spent the next 5 days distracting myself and all then when the time came she sent me a pdf file with 12 pages of her thoughts over those days of how she was scared and pressured by her family and she loved me and found me to be the most perfect guy ever and all and she dreamed of this and at first i was a little resentful and said a bit of harsh words but then we hashed it out and got back together now skip forward another 2 months and the same exact thing happens she breaks up with me for feeling overwhelmed and not ready for a relationship and this time it was my last straw and i just said okay and was done a week later i found out she blocked me out of no where mind you i have friends who still follow her and one of them talks regularly to het that told me shes done with relationshis she just wanted to move on and not be stressed by being with someone, and a few days ago i was on discord and i clicked on the private server i used to have with just me and her and i saw that someone joined and left with her exs name i messaged her saying why did he join our private server she said it was a dumb mistake and nevermind it then i said look i dont care what u do with anyone ur free to do anything u want but im just curious are you back with him she then proceeded to say that she doesnt wanna sound heartless or crule but our relationship was a mistake and shes sorry and i was the perfect guy i didnt say anything to that i just repeated my question and she said yes mind you this ex she dated before me SAed her called her every  cuss word and told her he would kill her if he saw her again and back then when i was still with her and he found out me and her were dating he flipped out and called me every name and trying to act tough with me so i just blocked him and he went to lisa and procedded to do the same with her and now i find out theyre back together

 so now im just at a loss cuz what did i ever do in life to have all of this happen to me and did i even do anything wrong here so if anyone can just give me their thoughts it would mean a lot and sorry it was a really long rant",0.25462922,0.05086332,0.04048799,0

Long story short, I supported that woman. I still do. Even when there is a student debt crisis going on in the US, I was there for her. I paid off her schooling debt, offered her housing, and even took care of her children. I only asked for one thing in return: fidelity. Truly, that was too much of an expectation for her. So I have caught her cheating, and told her about it. I also have video recordings of her doing the deeds. I am really at a loss for words. 

I first suspected she was up to something when she didn't check in with at the scheduled daily times. In our relationship, I struck up a deal with her to check in with me three times a day. After repeated episodes of her not doing that, my suspicions arose. I don't want to think of myself as her protector, but relationships require serious commitment. Serious synergy between two people to strengthen and grow that relationship. 

She and I are still in a relationship. It's just that my expectations are lower, and I am thinking of looking above the horizon for a someone else. Reliability and fidelity are really important to me.",0.112540044,0.060927123,0.008731495,0

Evolutionarily of course, female loyalty was far more important. The male could be working to raise the offspring of another, and then practically his entire motivation for supporting his wife is nullified. This would certainly be the case if only a single child had been produced which was not his. In serial monogamy the female becomes more adept at manipulating the male with each successive partner. She will sometimes engage in &#039;trading up,&#039; securing a male who she sees as a better partner for herself and finalizing the transition even before she has dumped the old. By this means she can ensure she is never without a partner and supporter, even if that support, due to modern welfare systems, is only emotional.</span>",0.22311419,0.08533409,0.18002926,0

I’m currently 19 years old, and I’m a recovering addict, I spent most of my teenage years experimenting with substances and just feeling a little out of place. Instead of making memories back then I used, and over time it really affected me bad I had to go to jail from school and rehab like 5 times all throughout the state of Ohio. Anyways this post isint about all the trauma or how I lost my mom in a car crash at 12 changing my whole life.

Granted he’s got a girl and a brand new house and a job, so apart of me thinks he’s just growing up and becoming an adult, but I can’t get that feeling of wanting to make up for all the lost memories out of me, because truth is he has a lot of other friends he hangs out more than me, it’s been years and so I don’t even really know how much he’s changed, he probaly sees me as someone he’s gotta let go, but it’s just hard when you’ve known someone your whole life and you thought things would eventually get back to a state of where your life would be how you wanted it but it’s not, and I miss my damn friend, and I’m pissed I didint do more to hang out with him.

I’m in the US (I’m Canadian) for a wedding.

I was looking forward to it, but it’s being ruined by my heart rate.

I’m avoiding measuring it because I know that’ll send me down a hole, but I can feel it and it’s fast. Last night I couldn’t fall asleep because of it. I’m just feeling overall anxious being away from home. The trip was paid for by the family, which honestly makes me feel more trapped because you can’t just bail lol 

I keep telling myself that I went to the doctor for a checkup literally the day before we left (I’ve had some issues with elevated blood pressure for years but it’s been stable) and they said all looked/sounded good. At home, where I’m comfortable, my resting heart rate hovers around 60. So this is likely just anxiety, with maybe a side of sleep deprivation. I have out of country coverage through work if things go seriously wrong, I’m not stranded in that regard. I’m only here until Sunday so in less than 48 hours we’ll be on our way home, which makes me feel somewhat better.

But I’m struggling here. I want to enjoy my trip. I don’t want my fiancé worrying about me. Anyone have any helpful tips or exercises ?",0.06421452,0.022255141,0.011099357,0

I swear, people with money live in a completely different reality. It’s not even about jealousy it’s about how out of touch they are. They don’t realize how many people around them are struggling just to make rent, buy groceries, or keep their car from getting repossessed. I have my own parents asking me for money bc they’re struggling when I’m honestly poor myself but they’re too proud to ask my rich sister.

And I’m not even talking about people who used to be poor and “made it.” Because honestly? This is the worst time in history to be poor. Everything costs more, wages haven’t caught up, and debt just snowballs. So anything those people say about “how they got out” doesn’t mean much to me ,the world isn’t the same as when yall were struggling.

How can you have family or friends drowning financially and not even offer to help? Where’s the empathy ?

I'm just completely worthless. I'm ugly, I'm fat, I feel dumb all the time. I can't think of one single positive trait I potentially have. 

The very bad thing is that I feel lonely lots of times and I long for human connection, but at the same time I don't really meet up with anyone or if there is someone I know at the store or something, I avoid them instead of saying hi. The reason why is because I'm ashamed of myself. I'm ashamed how I look, I don't want them to ask questions about me, because I'm afraid that if I answer honestly then everyone will know that this person is not worth anything because they don't have anything to share or they haven't achieved anything.

Not a single person I have known reached out to me ever and honestly part of me takes a bit of an offense in that. Sometimes I think: ""Why should it always be me who runs after everybody? If I matter than they should put in effort as well.""

It's really a mix of emotions. But I feel like I completely ruined my life and that everyone hates me. I feel guilty all the time for coming to a new country and abandoning my family. I hate myself.",0.37751234,0.3388922,0.10409598,0

Its as simple as that I have insomnia the doctors gabe me a 2 week course of medication that is unsuitable for long term use. So what the doctors did was refer me to the mental health team and I explained this. I get about 4 hour max of broken sleep a night im in pain when I try to get to sleep my joints ache and I have to constantly toss and turn to stay comfortable long enough to sleep. The person I talked to said that trauma can cause insomnia and well life hasn't been easy for me like the universe is playing what to do whith her next. I've been on 4/5 medication for depression all have had bad reactions so I was took off. And therapy didn't work not that I'm unwilling to try but I spent 2 years in talk therapy 3 months in another one and 6 months in CBT and the CBT made my mental health worse and the others didn't do much simply because they didn't know how to treat an autistic adult in therapy and them trying to make it seem like I was stupid and didn't know what I went through that my dumb autistic mind couldn't comprehend what happend to me and that I'm overreacting. Like no I was abused as a child then by my peers in school then by similar aged adults I know what I went through. I told the person I was talking to that the only thing that actively helped me sleep was medication all that they said was well we can't do that. So I've essentially given up on medication therapy and guess I've accepted that I'm probably going to have shitty sleep for the foreseeable future. They want to help me sleep but won't give the only thing that helped its so hard not turning to substances to help me sleep like I understand that medication won't work forever but what are they doing to do let me suffer and hopefully one day magically my insomnia good poof and im sleeping normally.",0.059974585,0.021803947,0.008028535,0

I met my spouse when I was 20 and he was 30. We met online and his profile said he was younger than he really was. He told me in person right away so I respected the honesty at the time.

I think I feel this way because we have had a boat load of issues around parenting and him not being a super great spouse to me.

So, about a week ago I had a dream about something that I did when I was around 9 or 10 years old, and it sort of awoke a repressed memory, and now I’m honestly kind of in disbelief and almost a little disturbed...

When I was younger, I learned that astronauts wear diapers when they go into space (because of spacewalks, etc.), and for some reason, I thought this was such a convenient idea. I was really curious about it and I decided to wear a diaper and pee in it (yes, I understand this is crazy). I had thought the urine would evaporate or something, and obviously, it didn’t. I was totally disgusted afterward, and I just kind of forgot about it. I only remembered this story recently after having a dream about it.

Now that I’m an adult (22), I’m kind of processing it and trying to make sense of it. I have no weird interests or anything like that, and today, as a rationale adult, I'm just baffled that my curiosity led me to do something so odd.

Is it normal for kids to do crazy stuff like this just because they’re curious?

Looking back, I knew it wasn’t exactly *normal*, but I wasn’t really concerned about it either. It was just my brain trying to understand something in the only way it knew how. Is this something that other people did as kids, or was I just *that* weird?",0.10696511,0.03412145,0.008657498,0

I’m 19. I studied Occupational Therapy in my first year and eventually shifted to Psychology because of financial and mental health issues. I chose Psychology knowing it could heal me and break me at the same time. Since I became an irregular student, I decided to apply for part-time work. I even sacrificed one subject just so I could work 5 days a week while juggling online classes and onsite classes during my two rest days.

Being irregular also meant less interaction with my original classmates, since most of the subjects they’re taking now… I already took during my OT days.

I still have my friend Cha — we met back in SHS, grade 12. She’s kind, down to earth, always late but still shows up, and she’s incredibly generous. Medyo sad lang because she’s in QC now for nursing school, while I stayed here. We have two other friends: one joined me in the OT program, and the other went to another school for architecture.

I’ve never felt this lonely before. What’s ironic is I used to be the most sociable person you’d meet back in my early teens. But now, as I’m getting closer to “adulting,” working and studying at the same time, most of my hobbies — gaming, watching movies or series, discovering new songs — have been pushed aside. I don’t enjoy the things I used to enjoy. And even though I love my job, it doesn’t really relieve the loneliness. I tried coping by keeping myself busy, but in the end, I just made myself more stressed and drained.

Maybe this is why… I can’t have this conversation with anyone in my life. I don’t have that kind of friend who will really listen and take me seriously. :((",0.06817148,0.02657372,0.011469335,0

I’ve got this coworker I’ve known for about a year and a half. We connected really naturally — same music, same sense of humor — and ended up talking a lot, even outside of work. We’d text for hours, share playlists, and it just felt easy and genuine.

The thing is, that friendship started to mean a lot to me. Maybe more than it should have. It wasn’t romantic, but it made me feel seen and appreciated in a way I hadn’t in a long time.

Lately, though, things have cooled off. She’s got her own life, and I get that — but I find myself missing what we had. I’m not trying to chase her or make things weird, just struggling a bit with how to step back emotionally and accept that the connection might never be the same.

My boyfriend is an amazing person, we have had marriage plans since shortly after we met around 3 years ago. He is always by my side, has stood to me in times of great distress and has made sacrifices to be with me, even moving countries without even being married yet. 

But no one likes him. My friends always wondered how I can be with him, that I am so much better looking and he looks awful compared to me. I have practically gone no contact with my parents because they think I am only with him out of pity and that he is an embarassment to be seen with us. 

I hate to admit it, but he does have actual physical deformities. Medical deformities. He doesn't really care for his looks, goes to the gym or otherwise makes himself appealing. I have even confessed to him I sometimes cannot take him out and introduce him to friends because of how he looks. Many people have judged me behind my back and said horrible things when I introduced him to them. My physical attraction is not really there and I feel like I am stuck with a person because of all the good they have done to me and I have to repay back. I am still young and am not sure if anything I do is the right lifelong choice, in any area of my life. 

What should I do? I have spoken about all this to him but he just doesn't seem to ever stick to a change. He doesn't even go to the doctor about some of his medical issues.",0.22579013,0.0820023,0.052944973,0

351431609,reddit,offmychest,1763731433,"I dated my rapist for 3 years

I (f24) recently left the now ex (m39) after a 3 year relationship. Im AuDD and he has ADHD. Facts stated, onto the story. 

I met him for the first time on a night out with just a couple of friends, where he was sober giving one of my friends a lift home. I found him attractive but thought the age gap was too much so i shrugged it off. The night it happened was on a celebratory day in my country where a lot of people go drinking, all bars are full and a lot of people get shitfaced. Including me. I was on antidepressants and we all know thats a bad combination with alcohol. Well, I dont remember half the night, what I know about the part i cant remember, i have had to puzzle together with stories from friends and the ex. I obviously knew something had happened, i could feel it when i woke up. I didnt tell anyone about it. Never have and never will, not to people that know me, at least. 

Forward to him charming his way into my life. Inviting me out on dates and home to meet his family. I was lonely, looking for affection and this is what i settled with. Today, I think to myself, that i wore a pink blindfold and did not see all the red flags and all the narcissistic signs before i had wasted 3 years of my life on that boy. Yes, boy.

This boy even has a 6 year old daughter. Who I met and got a relationship with. Not as a step mom, just dads girlfriend. She lives in an institution, for reasons i realise today. 

The first year was fun, had a lot of trips and good times but then things started to go downhill. He would be annoyed if food wasnt ready when he got home. He would reject me when I asked him for sex, but would convince me every time he wanted to do it. He would make me feel bad for sitting at my pc, having fun with my friends when he wasnt home. I convinced myself he was right.

The worst parts, and what finally made me realise i was stuck in a hole and he was throwing dirt on me, was how he behaved in the following situations. 

This summer, his father slapped me on the ass. I have previous history with men doing so, all the way back to when i was 14 years old. His father has always been uncomfortable to be around. Always breaking the personal space bubble and talking very loudly. So this shook me heavily. I have been dealing with depression and no job for a long while (because the ex dragged me down, i now realise) so this slap on the ass ruined my day completely. The ex wasnt near us when his dad did this so i told him when we got home. He shrugged, and said he will talk to his dad about it. His dad completely changed the story and he came home to me, saying he didnt know who to believe so I had to sort this myself. First. Red. Flag. I. Saw.
Second situation: a friend of his dads daughter, a 15 year old girl had started hanging out with the ex, when he was in the garage at his dads place. I knew her, brought her along when we went places and talked with her many times. Then comes her bday. Where the ex is invited but not me. Previously, i had asked him to stop texting goodmorning and goodnight with her, to not let her steal his shirts and not have alone evenings with her. He also came home one day, saying that I was the only one of his girls still awake. As in, his daughter was asleep, our female cat was asleep and the 15 year old had texted him goodnight. I frowned. 

The day before her bday, he told me he was excited to go but also to remember that I wasnt welcome. I texted my best friend at this point, asking if this was normal. No, it was not. 

On the day of the bday, i also texted my mom and sister asking what to do. They suggested giving him two options. Either we both go or we dont go.
He got pissed when i said this to him. How dare I want to go to a place im not welcome and ruin her bday. So he chose not to go, but i could join him at his fathers place, cause then he had to do some things there instead. So against my will but stubborn as I am, i joined him. His father did not speak to me at first. Later he yelled. Yelling at me, that I should not control who his son speaks to and that I should not walk around town spreading rumours of sexual assault. It made him sad and he feels like he cant go anywhere anymore. I didnt give him a single reaction, other than, telling him its never been ok for a minor to have a relationship like that to a grown man, its never been okay for men to slap womens asses. I told him he would never see me again, so he should have nothing to worry about. The ex had left the room when this happened btw, he did not care. 

So, next day arrives. My parents had plans to visit to help with some renovations but my mom called me asking what was happening. Apparently, the ex had texted them not to come, he wasnt home. He had moved out to his dads place for a week. When i asked him what that was about, he said he doesnt understand why I dont trust him, and left. 

So, I was done. When my parents arrived I told them it was over. 3 days passed by and I was out. All my stuff was out of the house, my cat was picked up and my address was moved. 

What did he say when i told him im leaving? 
""Im sorry to hear that, hope we can still talk"" then he proceeded to tell my mom to take care of me, and started talking about random work he needed to get done during the week. 

I dont believe this boy to be intentionally evil. But his parents and legacy from how they have treated him, has made him like this. He should know better. He promised me so many things and as a young insecure girl I didnt know better.

Just after 2 months, im so much better, more social, more energy and more motivation. Theres order in my things, my head. Of course i still deal with my insecurities but I catch myself thinking negatively and tell myself no, thats an old habit, make a better one.

117687082,reddit,offmychest,1762092824,"I resent my mother for not trying

I sound like an ass I know but I just want to vent.

I (27F) didn’t grow up with my parents. My mother had me when she was young and couldn’t afford to raise me so I grew up with a relative and lived a pretty privileged life.

When I was 15 I was kicked out of the house (hilarious story for another time) and that’s when I started ‘reconnecting’ with my parents. It was the first time meeting my father and seeing how they live etc.

Now I want to make it clear that where I’m from, there’s a lot of poverty and life is not easy, but I guess you can say that about any place really. I was lucky to get a good education so even when I stopped living with my aunt, I’ve managed to get a job take care of myself. I’m by no means rich but you know, I have a roof over my head and I eat everyday and I’m healthy.

My father works for a church and my mother works for the local council and they love their kids and respective spouses (I’m their fist born).

Recently (maybe it’s because I’m going through a career crisis and I’m looking for how to better my life), I’ve started resenting my parents (mostly my mother). I’m surrounded by people who are from strong family units (no family is perfect of course) and even at my age, I can see the difference between myself and my peers whose parents are accomplished and are able to guide them through their careers, marriages, school etc.

Of course I understand that people come from different backgrounds and and I don’t want money or anything from my parents, but I always joke with my mother and say when your friends were buying land and gaining assets for themselves and their kids, where were you? My thing is that she doesn’t try to do better for herself. She doesn’t want to go back to school, she doesn’t what to start a business, she’s comfortable living in her poverty but I have 2 younger siblings and I don’t think that’s fair to them.

I help out when I can but, I wonder why she doesn’t want to push herself, even just for the sake of her kids. She’s married to a very hard working man and he tries his best but I imagine how different her life would have be for her if she applied herself. Hell all our lives, maybe I wouldn’t have gone through what I went though as a kid (but dwelling on the past doesn’t matter now I know).

I know I sound judgemental but from the time I was 15 to now when I’m 27, her life and living conditions have not improved. Her sisters are constantly building their lives and trying to be better but she doesn’t want to change. I sometimes feel like if I had parents who planned and were intentional, maybe things would be (not be easier) but maybe better. I’m so scared of failing because that means living a life like hers but I know that’s unkind and unfair. Because of this resentment I find myself pulling away from my parents and to an extent the rest of my family.

Even the conversations we have are not inspiring, nothing on how to achieve certain goals, just mundane things that don’t even matter. I would say maybe she grew up in a different time and has a different mentality but the people around her are evolving. It’s not really my business since she’s happy (I guess) but I feel so… disappointed.

I’m probably coming off as high and mighty but that’s just how I feel.

I don’t talk to my parents much (I don’t talk to anyone much in general) and I want to be more connected but visiting my mother is depressing.

If you’re wondering why the heat is only on my mum, my dad himself is a humble man but he put himself through graduate school so that he can earn more for his kids. I have my issues with him (another hilarious story) but he’s trying. Even her husband is putting himself through school so that he can better himself.

I’m a 24 year old mom in school. my son is 4, I’m married to a great man, and I love my little family so much. I would do anything for them. But recently i feel like even doing everything I can do is not enough.

I’m unemployed at the moment because I injured my hip at my last job. It was an injury from repetitive use and the job required me to walk a lot during the day (literally dog walking for 6 hours with little to no breaks) so i knew i couldnt keep doing it without severe consequences to my health and i quit. I live in NYC so you would think thered be endless jobs i could get but ive applied to over 200 since then and there’s nothing. no responses. no letters informing me i wasn’t selected. just silence.

we are in debt at the moment. our car is about to be towed or get a boot on it for like the 3rd time in 2 months because everytime it seems we’ve paid off our tolls or tickets, we get mail saying we owe thousands of dollars more that we didn’t even know about and that is the god honest truth. we did not know. currently they’re asking for almost $2k and they won’t give us a payment plan. we have about $5k more debt in bills that we have to pay off immediately as well.

it feels like my husband is giving up on me. it feels like he doesn’t see how hard i’m trying. to him i guess it seems like i’m at home all day doing nothing, when really i’m busy raising our son, trying to find a job, trying to do everything i have to do for school, and losing my fucking mind. i am not okay with our situation. at all. but to be fair to him i do act pretty nonchalant about it, because i know crying and screaming and getting angry won’t help. and i think that combined with me not seeing any result from my effort is maybe why he feels this way. 

but i am really, really stressed, and depressed, and i’m starting to believe that i am just wasting space here. i feel like my effort is all for nothing. it’s not producing any kind of result. it’s not making things any better. i can’t contribute financially. i don’t even have $2 to my name. any kind of money i get goes directly to our family’s needs. and it’s not a lot. 

i know my son needs me and i would never want to leave him. but the idea of just offing myself is pretty tempting i’m not gonna lie. it’s selfish and horrible, but i think about it a lot. genuinely i feel that life is not worth living for me, and i feel bad that i brought another person into the world to deal with it. although i know my son will do great things when he gets older and be better off than i am, i just hope he never has to feel the way i feel now. 

not really looking for advice, just ranting to the only place i can without being institutionalized lol. thanks for reading.",0.09112182,0.02567133,0.0064006294,0

117709545,reddit,offmychest,1762082444,"My step dad had a massive heart attack

On Halloween, 7am, my mom asked my step dad to start her car. I don't remember the context of that morning or why he was starting the car. All I remember is the haze of him clutching his chest and saying he may need to go to the hospital. I called 911 because my mom started panicking. I rushed to get my jeans on because I fully intended on going but my mother had me stay behind to take care of their animals. I am staying with them through a divorce and it's been hard to find a place to rent.

He had one stent put in, previous to this. I waited hours to hear back. My mom eventually called to tell me it was a massive heart attack. That they went through his wrist to give give five other stents. That he was shocked back to life five times (later found out it was four). We've been up to visit him twice since then but have been letting him rest.

I obsessively think about my parents dying, and what might happen once they do. We are all very close. My family lives on one big farm compound in Northern Michigan and we are all very supportive of each other. This was life's rude wakeup call for me. I've been thinking about the very disturbing reality of losing him now. He's more of a father to me than my bio dad. 

I wish I could reassure myself that things will go back to normal. His heart is functioning at 35 percent. I don't want to see my mom go through losing the love of her life after her struggle finding love through my teenage years. We have lost so many people in our family. Please. I need good energy.

47120769,reddit,depression,1761589378,"how to help someone with depression in more subtle ways

my brother has been diagnosed with depression and last month attempted suicide. me and him have never been the type to talk openly about personal things, and while i do hope to change that, it is just hard to break the habit. (also it is difficult to find a moment to even attempt an deeper conversation one on one as our parent's are obviously howering a lot in the wake of recent events.)

in the meantime I still wanna help him in more subtle ways as he usually closes up if you try to approach the elephant in the room directly. me and him like to bake together, and i've tried to do that more often as it does cheer him up, but it still feels kinda hopeless as obviously that doesn't fix the main issue at hand. I'm not trying to find a magic cure, as that doesn't exist but I just wonder if there are other ways similar to baking that could be more subtle ways to tell him I'm here for him whenever he needs it.

he's lately been talking a lot about harming himself and I really do feel horrible not doing anything for my little brother. I have a history with it myself and I wanna shield him from that if I can. but I don't know if that's possible with the way I'm going about it. 

anyone have any tips? any activites that might help us get closer or just an excuse to spend time together.",0.054531995,0.01640493,0.007880543,0

Seriously, this isn’t a brag. This account is new and it’s just something I finally have the courage to discuss .

My dick is 22cm long, and 16cm in girth.

I had a date last night which went great, one thing led to another and we went back to hers.

We tried multiple times, but it just wouldn’t fit in her. This was never an issue with my last gf, but since coming to uni and having casual sex this happens all the time. 

I’ve been told it’s a blessing, and to be grateful but it just seems to cause more problems than the benefits it offers. You’d think the personal comments when people pass round rumours about it or the stares in the gym would be made up for if it actually helped in bed. But I feel like there’s a limit to what women can enjoy and I’m passed that.

I can have sex, there’s many women I’ve succeeded with after a lot of trial and error, but usually, if she’s short, it won’t work.

This girl was 155cm and I’m 193cm. I really like her, but now think we just aren’t sexually compatible and this happens all the time.

For context, I fought with major depression for a solid 20 years of my life. All day, every day, all I could think about was ending it. I got health insurance, got diagnosed and medicated, and things seemed to be going pretty well for a few years. Anyway, it's back and it's really bad. It feels like my meds have been replaced with skittles for all the good they're doing.

And a week or so ago I ran into a rant/vent comment on a different sub from my spouse, and I can't stop the depressive spiral. My sleep has been garbage and I'm having more days where I think about oncoming traffic or tall buildings. I haven't been able to do anything. And, of course, that's what my spouse was venting about.

My ex (24f) and I (24m) had been on and off since December 2020. We were 19, and we had dated over the summer of freshman to sophomore year when we were 14. She had left me for another woman then. 

When we were 19 we both lived with our parents, she practically moved in with me in the first 2 weeks of dating, my home was chaotic, and her home was the same. We started  living at her place when my sister kept creating fights and making my house unbearable to live in. Her dad died January 2021 and I went with her to the funeral in another state, watching her ball her eyes out I promised to his casket that I didn't want to see her sad like that again. We got our first apartment midway through 2021. I had a full-time blue collar job and she was working as a server. Our schedules were so conflicting we started putting Monday aside to have a day to spend together. Few months into this lease, she was spending time with friends at clubs constantly and I was playing video games, and smoking weed constantly. Our relationship started falling apart. Before our next lease, she broke up with me. I had been planning on going into the military and she said the only way we would stay together was if I married her. We broke up because she felt like I wasn't putting in enough effort with dates and such. We got back together cause I was putting in effort again trying to pick up the pieces. Not long until our next lease, we broke up again because of a fight we had in our new apartment. In that next month I had asked if she was seeing anyone else and she wouldn't tell me because single and that wasn't my info to know about. But we also were having a lot of breakup sex for a week. Month or two later she finds out she's pregnant and flips a switch trying to act like a perfect partner. We had previously agreed not to have a kid if I got her pregnant and we had used plan B but she wasn't gonna abort this one. Near the end of the pregnancy I felt conflicted about being a dad, she wouldn't admit to sleeping with other people at the time I got her pregnant, we had previously agreed to not have a child and I didn't trust that switch up she did. She suggested having my sister move in with me and take over her spot on the lease and she was gonna stay at her sisters. I thought this sounded like a good idea and would provide less stress for the pregnancy as to not stunt the baby being born whether I was gonna be there or not. After our daughter was born I came around and was there to help whenever I could. We started seeing each other again and eventually got back together but I had signed up to do commercial fishing in Alaska and had landed the job. She started living with her mom and while I was on the boat I hated it at first wishing I never left and seeing that our relationship was turning around I wished I was home. Second trip (you have to do 2 to get travel expenses paid off) I started coming around in the job and saw it as an opportunity. We discussed a plan of me going back after coming home and saving to pay for technical college out of pocket and get her a car. When I was home though, our relationship fell apart again. We weren't doing couples counseling anymore and I was more focused on saving money for our goals than spending it while I was home. I bought an suv that better suited our family needs and was a better family car than my coupe. She broke up with me again so I stayed instead of going back and picked up my old job. I was helping her family clean out a relatives house and she ""fell back in love with me again"" so we started seeing each other again. I moved back in with her again and she pushed for me to go into that technical college. I told her it was gonna cause more stress and disconnection in our relationship, she assured me that we were doing this for our family and we've got this. A few months in I told her I felt insecure about our relationship, that I could feel the disconnection growing and I wanted reassurance. She said, we've got this. About a month later we had a bad argument. Previously I would shut up and shut down, but in the last year I started started responding in these arguments. I was tired of being berated, devalued and yelled at and wanted to figure out how to communicate and stand up for myself. I could never get 10 seconds into a response without her rolling her eyes, dismissing what I was saying that ""we didn't speak the same language"" and I ""didn't listen"" then she'd walk away. She eventually spent the night at a house she was pet sitting for and we argued on the phone after I told her I wished the cars coming into our lot were her. She said she didn't want to be together romantically, we would coexist till I got out of school, I better get good grades and I better f'ing graduate. After this fight I carved time out of my schedule for us to go do something every week with our little family and then she broke up with me at the end of the month. We still had a trip planned for my bday about a week and a half out. It was good trip, good reconnection but she stood by not wanting to be together and at one point she gave me her phone to take a pic on Snapchat. I swiped over to see who she was texting and saw someone's name as ""my hotel"" with a bunch of hearts. She had been spending nights at her pet sitting houses often after we had that argument when she left for the night. She had written me something before that night we had the final straw argument but didn't give it to me or mention she wrote it till after the argument. So when we got back home I asked to hear what she wrote. Gist of it was that she felt ""majority unhappy throughout our relationship"" and she ""didn't receive the love, care, and attention needed to stay"" she also said she saw someone a year ago when we were broken up who made her feel all these honeymoon phase feelings but she cut them off cause she didn't feel like she deserved that relationship and I had been helping her family but she kept reminiscing on how that person made her feel when she was unhappy in our relationship. We set boundaries that night then like 2 nights later we set a plan. It was that we were gonna coexist and coparent until I was out of school and focus on our daughter. She then admitted that she was seeing someone else and I asked when it started, she said it started the day we had broken up. I said I figured then asked if I knew the person. She said I hadn't met them but they had met our daughter cause they used to get lunch together and she's bring our daughter. She tried saying this was a new man and I came to find out it was the same person she left me for when we were 14 but they've had a sex change and have changed so she didn't see them as her ex. Anyway, after revealing she was seeing someone else and tried playing it off like this was a new person, not from her past she went into our bedroom, came back out to share some funny stuff her sister sent her then came back out again and told me she was gonna go spend the night. I asked ""at his place?"" She said yes. So I out in my shoes and left to my sister's for 2 days. She was trying to get me to stay by saying she wasn't gonna leave and she'd stay but I needed my space. When I came back home she said she was changing our lease and now the two of us have separate 1 bedroom apts in the same complex. I took a pay cut because I leave work early for night classes and have 0 free time after being in school. I'm struggling, meanwhile she's being showered with attention by this new boyfriend and going out doing stuff with them constantly. We had agreed not to incorporate this person into our daughters life for at least 2 months (Nov 1) but my daughter started saying their name a week after my ex got her new apartment when our daughter used to never say their name. I eventually said just incorporate them, you already have and she was uncomfortable with me meeting them one in one, at a point sending me a page with articles about blended families and on that page were a bunch of articles about step parenting. Now Halloween rolls around and she brings this new boyfriend to a trunk or treat event at our daughter's cousin's elementary school. We re meet at her sisters house as the plan was to trunk or treat then truck or treat with our daughter and her cousins cause that would make her more comfortable. She didn't stay for the truck or treating stating that her and her new bf were gonna go pick up his friends for them to hang out with. I wasn't a bad partner, I'm a good man and a good father but I'm constantly being attacked even now while I'm trying to be as civil as possible. Anything that can upset my ex in a situation between the two of us becomes extremely disrespectful from her end. I spent years chasing being tolerated by someone rather than loved and respected. We both grew apart and we're both responsible for things not working. But it's so hard to move on from someone you envisioned a life with and invested a fifth of your life into. Plus I feel that I recognize that my life partner (whether we're romantically together or not) has a mental illness so I don't want to give up on them and ironically I don't want them to feel not worthy of all I have to give cause I've been told I'm unworthy of them for years. I'm trying to focus on school and my daughter but I stay up thinking of what went wrong. She's a hard, deep lover when she's in love but becomes bitter and mean when she's not. I know I did what I could and never stopped trying so I won't be losing sleep on that but I wish there was a way to make me stop thinking about them all the time. I know they're not thinking about me, their main priority now seems to be her and her boyfriend and our daughter. Im used to the usual advice of focus on your school and your daughter but that doesn't stop the thoughts. Anyone do anything that helped them move on?

A month ago I was warned by my teacher I’m currently failing the entire grade and have to repeat if I don’t pass these exams. 

My BPD, depression and adhd and other shi really have done a number on me. I’ve already attempted scide twice (OD) and Im a shitty person both my parents are still here I don’t deserve the right to complain.

They’ve scared me my whole life mainly due to other childhood traumas

I’m not close with any family members even my lil brother (he said he hates me). I went ghost for 4 months on social media came back to to no messages but I’m not worth talking to anyway

I’m genuinely a loser. I got cheated on in every rls I been in. I’m an alleged narcissist (my therapist doesn’t think so tho so that’s a plus ig). I’ve lost my faith and no longer believe in god. My friends are all going to good unis I’m not sure where I’ll be in 2 months… I’m such trash.

I’m Sorry just needed a place to vent I didn’t know where else to turn to.",0.47119883,0.336253,0.07425626,0

I (F19) have been entangled with Him (M41) the longest in comparison to every other relationship and friendship ever. I also just learned that he is likely the reason why I don't have friends and that is the consequence of being in such a relationship. I have known him since Age 17 and he was 39yr at the time. I didn't grow up in an abusive household. I just have an emotionally unavailable father and a controlling mother. He has a controlling emotionally unavailable father and his mother wasn't part of his life until he had turned 18. He was raised by his father and the mothers in laws. I know of his Wife but she was never really a huge topic. Him and I happen to have a few mutuals.

And we have been going through hell and back since I was 17. He flew me out to the south of Spain this June only to then leave me stranded. He did pay for the Hotel and Uber and others but it really freaks me out because he was controlling my every move during my stay without vent being in the same room as me. I keep asking myself If I haven't had any money, then what? I didn't beg him for the flight back. I flew myself back home with my own money a day after my arrival because I saw no point in staying. And my birthday was a day or two after that trip.

We never were physically sexual. He did however ask for nudes very often and when I didn't feel like sending him anything he said ""If you don't send them now I won't speak to you again"" the same way I had threatened him at least a hundred times to block him if he didn't do what I asked of him. I have had at least 3 relationships during my time with him and they all failed because I couldn't control myself and my mind drifted towards him, over and over again. My friends obviously hate him. He isn't attractive per se but I am. And every time I get these huge life changing opritunities he stops me from presuing them.

If you told my 18 year old self that we did graduate this august she would say you are full of shit. I almost failed academically because of him. I was crying at least once a week, my eyes were always swollen, I would cry in my sleep and stay restless all the time. Last time we truly spoke was a few days before my graduation ceremony which was late July but I still can't get over this relationship and I know that it is bad. Please don't hate on me, you can be fully honest I don't mind honesty and I have a psychiatrist and have had a few therapists but that doesn't work. I do have a career and many life goals and they aren't running away from me. I have learned how to separate my emotional and professional self. I am doing well professionally and academically just not emotionally.

I don't know what the right thing is. I have decided for myself that I am willing to go back to him over and over again until I had learned my lesson but that just becomes predictable and boring. I had begged him to leave me a few too many times but he obviously won't leave and the day before my trip to Spain I contacted the wife from an alt account begging her to check his phone especially his hidden photo album, to do ANYTHING but no response of course. One could argue that I had sabotaged the trip but I didn't. He was trying to make me stay longer than I had wanted to by messing up the logistics. He only told me what hotel I was staying at once I was in the uber he had ordered.

Also to add in case someone says that I am nothing but a sex toy to him (I honestly wish it was just that) Before my trip to Spain I was away for 6 months I thought new year new me but there wasn't a single day where I wasn't thinking of him and he does make me feel things I have never felt before. In late may I came back and started interacting with him after less than two days he offered to fly me out and for the first time in 1,5 years I had agreed to it. The goal was to get him out of my system and move on. So we agreed that it was going to be just sex. Guess what...he said that I was young and with that would regret sleeping with him. Despite ME being in the same city as him for the second time in over a year. He doesn't show up and I decided to leave the hotel and go out instead so I went out with a friend who happened to be male and live there. Once I have mentioned that I was outside after an hour later he said I will be at the hotel in 5 where are you? I said that I was on my way in the car and then he said nvm I had dinner plans anyway. I even texted him at night and early in the morning that he should just come and have sex with me. He kept stretching the time until it was time for me to check out. Once I was back in my home country I asked what his deal was and that we did have an agreement. His response was ""If it's meant to be it will be"" I felt incredibly stupid. I wasted money and time and effort to just end up where I was 1,5 years prior.

I know if I wanted to fix it, I’d need to see a doctor, but I haven’t been to a doctor in years. I can’t afford the dr visit and blood tests right now. And if it is a hormone imbalance they’ll just put me on pills and I can’t afford that long term either. I also know that a hormone imbalance like what I think I’m experiencing increases the risk of blood clots or heart disease. I’ve already decided that if I have a heart attack or stroke and die then that’s perfectly fine. I’ve been looking for a way out for years and if I’m going to die from a stroke because my hormones have been messed up, that’s fine. I just don’t want to deal with it. In the meantime, day to day, it makes me feel so gross and I hate the side effects I deal with. But I just deal with them. The irritability and mood swings are making me feel bad though. 
I don’t think my partner that I live with and have been with for many years actually loves me and I don’t blame him. I think he’s still stuck in the trauma from his last relationship and hasn’t healed from his marriage ending with his ex. I think he’s still has unresolved feelings about their marriage that he will probably never deal with. I think he’s in a relationship with me because it’s convenient and secure. I think if he was any healthier himself he’d leave me. But this is something else I just accept. It just sucks. Day to day, we’re happy with each other though. I don’t know if he’s just settled for me. 

Today I just feel apathetic. I tried going about my morning routine and doing the daily things that get me through the day and I couldn’t even try. Nothing brought me any pleasure and it felt like dragging myself around the house and my brain wasn’t present either. I just got tired of existing outside my bed, so I got back in it. If I feel nothing when I’m asleep I won’t know that I feel nothing. 
My best, oldest, and only friend got arrested for a DWI recently and hearing this completely came out of nowhere and shocked me. We live in different states now and I haven’t seen them in a couple years. This isn’t the same person I knew. I was totally blindsided and it’s unfortunately changed the way I see our friendship. I haven’t wanted to talk to my one friend and I wonder if our friendship will end soon. As lonely as I might be, I can’t see myself being friends with the type of person to drive drunk. But it hurts and is confusing because they are my oldest friend and I thought I loved them. It’s scary to think about and I worry about the loneliness might feel soon. I don’t have any family. I just have my boyfriend, and our relationship for the most part is great and comfortable. We get along well and live together and things outwardly look fine. But I just don’t think he really loves me like I love him. 
I have no money, education, or skills and what’s worse, no desire to pursue any of that. Every day I just wait to die.",0.10913446,0.025155678,0.009693438,0

TL;DR

I don’t feel like I’m a good fit for my partner and she’d be better off without me. What should i do?

I (32m) have been with my partner (35f) for 12 years now. We own a house together and have a child together (9) and she has a child from a previous relationship (15), The dad has never been around so I’ve raised them since they were 3.

I’ve never really felt satisfied in our relationship but I was a lost cause before I met her and she helped me turn my life around before it went south and I’ve always appreciated that. Our happy times we’ve spent together seem like they’ve only been happy because of what we are doing and not because we are together.

Thing is I do love her and my family but I just don’t feel like I’ve ever felt important and just feel like a disappointment all the time. I’m constantly forgetting things, I have major financial problems and I really struggle with listening and I’m constantly taking things the wrong way. I was diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago and it’s explained a lot of my behaviours but I can’t shake this feeling I’ll never be enough for her.

I’m sick of always letting her down and just feel guilty all the time and I just want to be happy.

I’m so lost and afraid of the future I just don’t know what I should do. Should I leave? We’ve tried to work things out but nothing seems to work. Or it will work for a little while and then revert back to the way things were. Any advice would be amazing",0.11347008,0.024382202,0.013948337,0

133578708,reddit,depression,1762215525,"I can’t hold it anymore

I do not know if I have depression or some other stuff, but I know I want to die since forever. Life started when I was 5, at least there I started to remember. And since then I had these thoughts.
When I was little my reason where the sexual abuse I had to endure and the divorce my parents had. On top of that it wasn’t just a divorce. They make me try to pick and said the worst about the other part, while they didn’t care to check on their daughter.
I ran with closed eyes one a street corner where cars wouldn’t see me. Sadly the car that run me over didn’t hurt me that bad.
Now that I’m older I can see, this was my first attempt.
Back then I often prayed to god that he should take me away as a sacrifice and take the pain away from kids that felt the same.
Needless to say, I don’t believe in god now.

I endured this all till I was 12 years old. Got badmouth a lot by my mother because I didn’t want to see my abuser (she didn’t know and he was part of the new family my mother made). Calling me a bad child all the time.
I felt like i don’t belong in any family. My dad had another girlfriend and my mother another husband with kids that came over the years.
Both trying to badmouth the other but just making me feel not belonging to someone.
One day the abuser stayed by our apartment and i needed to greet him because he was staying overnight. I couldn’t just don’t do it like I always did. My mother insisted.
I then I told her. She obviously was crying and confronted him. And obviously he was defending himself with „she seduced me“ and other stuff. She even found out, that my stepfather new about one incident because I told him. He told me he will take care and didn’t do none. He didn’t even asked me if there where other occasions.
I think she was in a deep hole after gering this info. Her world crumbled and her marriage too. She tried to deal with it by constantly talking to me about it.
Me on the other hand, was usually coping it with forgetting about it. This was Not possible for me anymore.
I started to self harm myself at this point because I couldn’t run away anymore like I used to.
And my stepfather just ignored it and tried to keep connecting with my abuser. Trying to show him my siblings, because he is still his grandfather and he was just a good dad for him back then.
My mother involved me in every detail. Each detail destroyed me. But i can’t tell how i feel, because she said I should not talk to him. So I was bottling up everything.
There where so much more happening what led me to go to the police. I filed a report, even though my mother urgently advised against it.
Because of unfortunate events and the testify of my mother the abuser didn’t got locked up. Didn’t even get a sentence. And I didn’t had the energy for second round.

After that my mother told me she was such a bad mother, because when I was 4 I told her he touched me. He brushed it off as he was lecturing me and slapped my hand back because I behaved bad. My mother knew I was a well behaved child. Really always.
She said in this moment she had a black out. 
I didn’t even know it started when I was 4. but it makes sense now that I didn’t reach out to someone. Because I tried to and was denied.

My first relationships where violent. I still have a scar in my face from the second on.
He even pushed me to online prostitution. I didn’t want to and numerous time I tried to quit, but he talked me in again or meet me with violence. It was hard to get out, because I had nobody. I came home with bruises or a blue eye, but my mother didn’t beat an eye because he was telling her I do it to myself. She believed it.
Often even said to me I can’t be with my siblings alone because she is scared I will do something to them. I Never did, said it or even thought about to be clear. I love my little siblings dearly and just want to protect them.
My second attempt where I cut my wrist was in this second relationship. I felt deep depression and hoped to get some strength from him. But he didn’t want me when i wasn’t happy and ready to party. So I say I can go home. I think to this day, he still thinks I was jealous because he was talking with a friend in his bathroom- meanwhile me being in his bedroom crying.
I just needed a simple hug.

I must say my last relationship felt like home. I think this was the first time I felt loved, understood and cared but also I felt guilty because I was not healed to feel everything. 
I needed to end it because the relationship drained me and I was 24/7 on my phone to escape reality. Sadly it went downhill because of some things. I don’t really want to go into detail, because i still love him dearly (his absence pains me deeply) and I think in this case both could have done better.
I just couldn’t go with him anymore in his journey, because I lost myself on the way.
But I do regret now that I found myself again a little bit (at least energy wise). Now I’m just 3-4 hours at my phone at least.

I never had a peaceful mind.
And it happened so much more. Now I’m in a point where i don’t really feel positive emotions. I only feel pain.
When I’m laughing, it does not feel genuine. It feels like I’m acting. Playing where I know back then i would have laughed for real.
I feel a deep void in me that just got bigger and bigger over the years. Each little or big sad event hurts me deeply more and more.
I usually got out somehow but I do not have hope anymore. I talked with friends, I did Walks, I tried to get a therapist (impossible in my town I really tried for half a year. My energy is leaving me i can’t anymore), I tried to be more active, really everything - but this feels different. I know i can’t bounce back.

I just want to die so bad. I just have this stupid instinct. I can’t cut deep enough.
I think I just wanna know, how can I die pain free and release myself? 
And please don’t come with I’m selfish, there are good things or so on. My life is shit thru and thru. It took one friend 5 hours to tell her everything and she even could admit that my life is like a drama and everybody hated me so far.
I do not have happiness anymore and I just want peace one time in life.
So if there is a method where i don’t need to hurt myself like that and do it with one go, please tell me.

I feel like this will help me. I only ask for kindness and a listening ear. I’m a 24 y/o female, and I am struggling with everything. Financially, physically, mentally, emotionally etc. I can’t afford my medications. I am lonely and I can’t stand it. I can’t stand the feeling of being invisible while there are so many others in the room with me. I’m a hairstylist I work with the most wonderful beautiful souled women I’ve ever met, I have my family out here but yet I still feel so incredibly alone. I don’t mind being alone but the feeling of loneliness is gut wrenching. When my coworkers all are talking about the plans they all have together and I’m the only one who wasn’t invited, when my family goes on a trip to one of my favorite places and they don’t invite me because they say I don’t like it there. My phone service is shut off so no one is texting or calling me not like it really ever happened before but now there’s no chance of it happening. I try with my all to make friends, make plans and just get people to be around but it’s always a no or they cancel last minute. I’ve truly never felt so alone. Part of me wants to just run away start somewhere new, never look back but the other part of me keeps trying but the more I try the more I feel like the last resort for everyone else. Im told I’m so loved but i don’t feel it, i truly don’t know what I do wrong. Why I can’t make friends or why nobody wants to hangout with me or invite me places. I try so hard and nothing. I’ve stopped getting my hopes up, got new hobbies but I still feel so alone. I’m 24 years old and I’ve never once gone out with girl friends I want that fun group that most girls have, and not having it makes me feel like I’m not pretty enough, the outcast, or I’m just not likable or good enough to be around. I don’t ask for much, I don’t ask for sympathy with this post I’m truly just doing this so I can get these feelings out of my mind and into something that isn’t just a pen and paper.",0.103060275,0.021417208,0.017264472,0

It sounds ridiculous, but by the age of 13 I totally lost my motivation to care about my life or what happens to me.

I lost my social life. It never recovered. I used to be friends with a lot of people, had a few really close friends. But then I lost all my friends. I lost all my social status and instead of being normal I suddenly became an outcast.

I lost my trust in family. They made me feel horrible when I started failing in life, they only made me feel worse about it. So I stopped trusting them too and thought they all hated me and looked down on me.

At 16 I started high school and I made a few new friends, I also fell in love with a girl who I thought I felt like I truly clicked with, who I truly felt I would be happy with, who I thought could motivate me to care about my life again. On some level, I thought that if I got a girlfriend I really liked, like her, then I could be happy and my family and friends could see that I was happy and congratulate me for no longer being a failure.

It never happened because I was too much of a coward to take the chances I got to get closer to her. Every time I felt hopeless about being with her, I retreated into pornography and video games and the internet, I gave up on everything else and as I lost more and more hope, I eventually failed my last courses in high school.

  
I'm 22 now and I still haven't gotten over it. I have no motivation to do anything aside from eating, sleeping and further depressing myself with porn and various masochistic fantasies. I don't even care about getting my family to like me or feel like I'm successful anymore. At this point it wouldn't even matter.

""Wow, he got his first girlfriend at 22? Wow, he got his first job at 22? Wow, he wrote a book at 22? Wow, he got into university at 22? Wow, he went to his first party at 22? He went out drinking with friends at 22?""

When I was 16 it would've been normal, it would've been healthy. It would've been proof of social success and healthy development. Now, at 22? It's not remotely impressive, it's more like a: ""better late than never"" and that's not enough for me.

I don't feel motivated to do anything because it's too late to be impressive. I'm unhealthy, I have unhealthy development, my life is fucked up and no amount of partying or friends or anything in my 20s will ever change peoples perception of me because they all know I'm a social failure.

  
I know I'm a selfish, horrible person. I know there's so many people who I've hurt because I refuse to care about myself unless I have some motivation to do so. Friends I've abandoned, family I've made to worry, people and duties I've neglected. I can't enjoy anything because I know it will never be as good as it could've been if I didn't fail to save my life by getting that girl.

I'm not suicidal but I'm at a point where I 've realized I don't care what happens to me, and I haven't truly cared since I was 13. I lost everything and I thought I could get it back and be happy again, but I lost the one chance I truly had to do so.

I'm at a point where it's too late to be normal, too late to be healthy, too late to be impressive. My options are to be nothing or to be exceptional. And I don't even have the motivation to be anything, much less normal, much less exceptional. Because I have nothing to do it for, nobody to do it for.",0.25462922,0.17610447,0.016963007,0

So in 2 days I’m going to a new school, again since I had to move after he kicked me out of my home with me, my mom and brother when I was only 10.

He abused me and my mom a lot,

Anyways this new secondary’s uniform is really different from my old uniform. 

and this new uniform costs 70 pounds.

My mom can’t obviously afford this and I decided to ask my dad to give me that money. 

He says , I quote.

“I can’t buy you everything, you don’t need that uniform.” 

and he has the CASH I’m talking thousands.

 and honestly I just had to say this because he is horrible and he’s making my life miserable.

Hi. (34/m/enby). Been around a bit, trying to keep other people going.

  
I think I am rapidly approaching my ""fuck it"" point. If you don't know, which you might not, it's a hypothesis I and possibly others have come up with where once someone reaches that point, there's not a single goddamn thing anyone can do to save them.

  
I think I am rapidly getting there. No, this isn't a, 'poor me, pity me' post. It's more of a, 'if this is how it's gonna be...' type of post. So buckle up. It's gonna be a bit of explanation.

  
I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, ADHD, C-PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, and I am self-diagnosed based on clinical presentation with ASD. Those, combined with a few other things, make me difficult to work with, get along with, etc.

  
And now we've got the looming uncertainties. Food insecurity knocking at the door of my home. The potential for *home* insecurity. Because of me. Because I can't keep a fucking job. Because I can't *get* a decent paying job. Because of this fucking heartless administration withholding funds. Shit like that.

  
But wait, there's more.

  
I'm a failing author wannabe. One book published, two almost published. Barely any sales. Barely anything to show for it. Just... failing all around. And now?

  
Well, I am to the point where *every waking moment,* my intrusive thoughts tell me about twenty different ways to off myself. It's like before I was medicated, but now about 600x worse. And at this point, I feel like an anchor around the necks of my fiancee, my daughter, our roommates, and everyone ***I have ever fucking known.*** I don't know what to do anymore.

  
I've worked as an AEMT, I've worked as a janitor, as a plasma center phlebotomist, all sorts of shit. None of it has given me an idea on what to do in this situation. None of it. I was training to be a 68W in the US Army. Went through the Battlemind bullshit, that did nothing.  I don't. Fucking. Know. Anymore.

  
My editor/boss/best friend says to just exist out of spite, but I am so low in the goddamn tank at this point that ""E"" may as well be a million gallons away. My car is barely holding together, I have to bleed for basic necessities, and even that goes mostly to bills.

  
I don't know how much longer I can hang on at this point.",0.62136006,0.40420914,0.10221587,1

449020570,reddit,depression,1764398298,"Is this a cry for help? Idk

The only reason I haven’t taken my life yet, is the thought that my 8 year old niece might be the one that finds me. She’s the only one that checks in on me. She’s the only one that cares. For her, I will continue to suffer. But if she wasn’t here, I’d be gone already.

I used to get so excited about the smallest things.. pretty stars, my cat doing something cute, my niece saying something funny.. learning something interesting in school.. It all seems so monotonous now. I learned today that one of my favorite authors is putting out the 6th book in the series and instead of getting excited I felt nothing. Nothing excites me anymore except drinking and feeling nothing. I know people say it will get better, and to keep going but for what? I know I’m selfish. It’s one of the things I hate about myself. Everything feels so exhausting and pointless. I don’t want to be here anymore.

But I won’t kill myself.. not for me, not for my future… I can’t imagine my niece or my sister being the one to find my body. And that’s why I keep going. I don’t want the people who did me wrong to thing they’re the reason, so I keep going… I don’t want my cat to come into my room for lovies and wonder where I am… if it weren’t for those things I’d be gone already.

I know that’s selfish. If you knew anything about my life you’d understand that this is the only selfish thing I’ve ever considered.

I don’t want any of you to save me, I just want a purpose.

I don’t even know how to put this into words. My little brother is in the US, and I’m far away from him. Yesterday he tried to take his own life. I only found out because one of his friends reached out to me, and everything I’ve heard since has completely overwhelmed me.

I hadn’t talked to him properly for a month, and suddenly I’m being told that he’s been dealing with something incredibly heavy. His friends cut him off, rumors started spreading, and he isolated himself for days. I also learned about painful things from his past things he never told me before and it all hit me at once.

When I finally spoke to him, he broke down crying. He told me he hadn’t eaten in a week. He said he felt alone, ashamed, terrified, and overwhelmed. Hearing him say those things and knowing he seriously tried to end his life… it broke me. I’m still shaking.

He’s my little brother. Yes, he made mistakes, but I can’t hate him. All I feel is fear and anxiety. I have a fear of losing him, fear of what happens next, and fear because I can’t be there physically to support him.

I don’t know how to tell our parents. He begged me not to, and I don’t want to betray his trust. But I’m also drowning in worry and guilt, and I don’t know how much longer I can carry this on my own. I feel completely lost.

I wish I could talk to someone in real life, but I’m terrified of accidentally starting rumors. So I’m posting here because I just need someone , anyone to hear me. I feel like I’m falling apart.",0.13041082,0.031036375,0.022992345,0

Just wanted to vent here and maybe get some help from anyone that feels the same way.
I've (26M), for mostly of my teenhood and early 20's untill now, have had low self steem due to my facial appearance (jaw and masseter). 
It's fairly assymetrical in a noticeable way (kinda like tyler posey from teen wolf) and this really gets me uncomfortable in most social settings. 
It got to a point that I hate taking pictures or even talking to people 1 on 1 feels like torture to me cuz I always feels like they are noticing everything about my face. Even when walking on the street and people glance at me I get this feeling and it's really exhausting to go through this everyday.

I go to the gym consistently, eat healthly and have a fairly good physique (5'8 - 172lb - ~10% bf). I've had a gf for 2 years a while back and also I've had more than once girls (and guys) approach me at uni parties, say that they find me attractive, made out with a bunch of them (girls) and that kind of stuff, but this really doesn't change how I feel and it gets me extremely depressed sometimes.

I just want to feel good about myself and really accept the way I look. This kind of struggle really takes away the joy of living for me.",0.15822013,0.046764325,0.037909906,0

Hey all!

Probably a couple of questions like this already here, partially wanted to vent a bit and looking for advice. In high school I was a kid with big social anxiety, went to see a few therapists, turned out I had GAD. I did not want to take any medication, so mostly we just did therapy, but it was really helpful. Still I had anxiety, but it got much better.

Now I’m in my 30s, and recently started to get pretty bad panic attacks. Felt like I had lots of things figured out, life is not that stressful. 

But oh no. First I noticed them on hights, like taking a cable car to top of a mountain, turned out was super scary , had a mild panic attack. Then more with these situations. Usually it seems to come out when I feel I can’t escape the situation fast. Elevator stuck, even car sometimes, like for example in a traffic jam, underground tram stops, etc. And some of these, I’m also afraid that I go into panic mode and accidentally jump out or something, because I feel I need to escape the situation and run away from the situation.  Never happened yet and I’d never do something like that  normally, I reallly like my life, so its very scary. Get very nauseous, heart rate very elevated etc. I’m afraid I’ll have a heart attack as well etc. 

It’s just really annoying, I’ll defnitely see a therapist again, but also wanted to ask if maybe something was helpful for these for someone, and to just write it out a bit.

Have hella anxiety all started because I took ciproflaxin like 2 years ago and then just unfolded. 

Got super fucked up one night and then the next night had terrible anxiety and when I went to sleep I woke up probably 30 min after I fell asleep and my left arm went numb or like it fell asleep. Thought I was having heart attack had to like clench my hand as hard as I could to get feeling back it was just buzzing.

Anyone else has had stuff like this happen . I’m 19m fit and lift always. Minor drug use but fuck this never took a toll on me the way it does now and I’m not even doing benders.

364104781,4chan,r9k,1763841339,"1. Saying dating is a meritocracy makes people feel morally safe. If dating is based on &quot;merit,&quot; then everyone who is successful can believe they earned it. They do not have to face the fact that a huge chunk of attraction is luck, timing, genetics, childhood environment, and personality traits they never worked for. The myth of &quot;meritocracy&quot; protects egos.<br><br>2. It is easier to blame the struggling person than admit randomness. If dating is not a meritocracy, then some people suffer through no fault of their own. Most people hate admitting that. So they say, &quot;If you just did X, you would get dates,&quot; because blaming effort feels safer than accepting unfairness.<br><br>3. A meritocracy narrative makes people feel in control. &quot;Anyone can succeed if they try!&quot; This sounds inspiring and comforting. Admitting that attraction is partially chaotic and irrational feels uncomfortable. So people choose the story that feels good, not the story that is accurate.<br><br>4. People confuse correlation with causation. Attractive or socially gifted people often just happen to do good habits. Normies look at them and say, &quot;See? They work out and socialize, so that must be why they succeed.&quot; But those habits often come after success, not before it. Confidence produces good habits, not the other way around.<br><br>5. Pretending it is a meritocracy absolves people from empathy. If dating works because of &quot;merit,&quot; they do not have to empathize with anxious, awkward, or unlucky men. They can say &quot;just try harder&quot; instead of acknowledging that the playing field is uneven.<br><br>6. Western culture is obsessed with the self-made individual. The idea that &quot;anyone can improve themselves into success&quot; is practically a cultural religion. Admitting that attraction is not fair threatens that worldview.<br><br>7. If dating is not a meritocracy, then: some people get lucky, some people get screwed, effort is not always rewarded, doing everything &quot;right&quot; might still fail, and some people succeed without even trying.

I was going to work  and walking towards a bus station. The station is across the street from the apartment I live in. While waiting at the red light I saw a police van and some car parked on the side walk. My first thought was that they stopped the guy for driving too fast or maybe he hit something. While going across the road I saw someone lying on the station bench - my next thought was that a homeless person got too drunk and fell asleep on the bench. I decided to not wait at that station and go to the next one. While walking past the bench I saw that it was actually a young woman, around my age, laying unresponsivelly in a fetal position. Policemens around her were wearing some dark plastic gloves. I remember thinking why are they not checking her vitals and why is no one covering her with a blanket as it is raining today and she has to be cold in her coat.  Then it hit me that she is probably dead as the ambulance should be there, or at least they would move her in more comfortable position/put the blanket over her. While waiting for the bus at the next station two ambulances drove past us and none stopped at the station with the girl.

I don't know how the f I even feel. I cried a little while driving. I left work after one hour cause I felt nauseous, my chest hurt like someone is sitting on me and I think I'm experiencing derealization. I texted my friends and my bf, but they are all at work rn.

443585073,reddit,offmychest,1764362077,"i wish i could say this to her

i know maybe you feel like i don’t care because i left you but that couldn’t be further from the truth. for the entire week after halloween all i could think about was how i could make it up to you if you gave me the chance and i couldn’t shake the feeling that i fucked it up and didn’t want to lose you over a mistake because that’s all it was, i never wanted you to feel the way i did or feel like i was punishing you because i don’t have any resentment for you and i never did. 


i’m bothered that you think i don’t care when you were literally the thing i cared about most in the world and i clearly just didn’t know how to express it. 

you said you’re ruined when i said my communication is bad but you’re not, you just need someone who makes you feel comfortable and not judged whenever you need to have an emotional or vulnerable conversation and i’m upset that you didn’t feel like you could with me. the time building up to it even though it was short it meant something to me and i don’t think i ever treated you poorly or said anything that would make you think i would judge you for talking about how you feel.

i don’t know if you’re actually bothered about the ayla thing but i’m gonna cover it anyway. i told you already that i didn’t know what to say since we hadn’t spoken about it but on a deeper level, i didn’t care about putting any labels on it so early because i know that the way i felt about you wasn’t restricted by a label and if you wanted one or to at least see where we stand you could have spoken to me about it. i genuinely didn’t think anything of that interaction afterwards and i didn’t mean to embarrass you and I’m sorry that you felt like that and to be honest when i knew you were meeting a lot of my work friends i should have spoken to you about what i would say when they asked because of course they were gonna ask.

i actually don’t know why i can’t drop this situation. well actually i do it’s because whenever i ever start to feel like someone wants something more than friends i cut them off not because i don’t find them attractive but because i feel like most girls don’t have any personality and it bores me but you were different, being around you and speaking to you was enjoyable not that i don’t enjoy being with other girls but something felt different with you. maybe it’s because you have eyes that can tell me what to do, or your hair that’s somehow always perfect, or the way you kicked your feet and freaked out whenever i breathed on your neck. i could go on forever about things i like about you which is annoying because it’s over but i can’t help feeling like it shouldn’t be. it was too perfect, or maybe you felt too perfect and that’s why i cant drop it.

i don’t know where i’m going with this but the time away from you between halloween and now really makes me realise what i lost. not getting voice notes ranting about your day or about work or about basically anything because you would actually just yap about the most random shit. i don’t get to save anymore photos of you in the chat when i think you look gorgeous, which was just about all of them. i don’t get to text you from when i wake up until i go to sleep. trying to watch Netflix in your bed and being too tired to concentrate on anything but you, or maybe i didn’t want to.


maybe for you i was just another guy who disappointed you but to me you were the only girl i actually wanted since my ex which was 2 or 3 years ago, and i know that you would do the same things with the next guy as you did with me, but i don’t know when the next time I’ll feel this way about a girl is gonna be, and that doesn’t feel right when you are right there and you’re all i want.


i don’t know if you’re ever going to be able to forgive me and i know that most likely nothing i can say will be able to change your opinion on me. i don’t know where I’m going with this because I’m not gonna beg for you to forgive me and try again because if deep down you still think of me as the same guy who left, the relationship would never get anywhere but that isn’t gonna stop me from hoping that you can get over what happened and see me for what i actually was during the relationship which i would like to think was someone who cared, and someone who showed it, but maybe not. i definitely know something though and that’s that i made effort for you, like driving 50 minutes there and back after waking up at 4am and working 9 hours then getting up at 4am the next day, or driving us around even though neither of us knew where we wanted to go or where we’d end up, but you couldn’t give any effort back after halloween even if you did in your brain.


i don’t think these even really scratch the surface of how i really feel, but i don’t have words or chance to fully express it and it hurts knowing you’re never going to read this",0.4826145,0.24928534,0.053854458,0

I am 30F and despite being successful, educated,  living alone, taking care of myself I have never had anyone seriously interested in me beyond sex. 

I have done years of therapy and this is the one negative self belief I have never been able to shaken. I'm a logical, analytical person and when I present the data to myself, I am the only common denominator. 

Ive never had a relationship and the only reason men are interested in me is to play me, make me feel like shit and leave me all alone. I've waited months and built up strong emotional connections(so I thought) but at the end of it men were either upset I didn't sleep with them or when I did they acted like I didn't exist to them any more. 

I've dated all types of people, race, education, income, religion, etc. And I have a ton of close friendships and am very close with my family. I know how to build and maintain relationships. So it's not a lack of ability or an example of me only going for certain types. There is something wrong with me 

I don't believe I will ever experience a relationship or romantic love of any kind. I think there is something that everyone else can see about me that I can't that let's them know not to care about me. I must be deeply, profoundly unlovable to have been treated like this by 100% of men I have dated. 

My next steps in therapy will be to abandon the will and want to be loved. I cannot deal with any more pain due to my own innate shortcomings. But even the idea of giving up hurts so badly. I don't know what I've done to be treated this way.",0.30502358,0.0573046,0.031980325,0

So, I'm 27 y.o. My whole life has been shit, I had an extremely abusive family, I managed to run away at 18 and since then I've been working to survive. I have dreams, I want to do things but I have no money or ways to do them. Because I have no more then a high-school diploma, all I can work is minimum wage shitty jobs that only gives me enough money to survive paycheck to paycheck. I got no friends, no family. Is hard to make friends when you work constantly and you're too exhausted to do anything else. I do not drink, I never smoked, never did drugs. Still, I have a chronic illness an have to take pills for the rest or my life. I want, I wish very much to study science in university and get a PhD and leave this shit country and work in a research lab. But with my job, in this country, it is simply not possible even if somehow I manage to put some money aside for schooling. I don't want this life, there is nothing for me to live for, no future, I feel an engulfing dread when I think that I already worked like a slave my whole life and will have to do it 30+ more years, if I even survive until then and if I'll afford to retire. But, at the same time, I feel like I haven't lived at all and hope that something will change, luck will strike me and somehow I'll get to live for once. I feel it's so unfair, I don't want money to buy mansions and fancy cars, I want money to finnaly live and to study something I always loved and become good at something, work something that will bring me joy.

I'm 37 years old and I have not engaged in the extremely common practices of oral sex, anal sex, and kink. My experience with Women has been limited only to kissing sessions,giving and receiving heavy petting,manual stimulation, and erotic messages along with vaginal sex. Despite my age and other life experiences I have not gone any further with any Woman than what I have just mentioned. I know that it is beyond strange for a Straight Man my age to be limited in his experiences like I have and the issue of not having more experience hasn't come up even after picking up a lady from a bar. I only started noticing that I was different when I started dating a kinkier woman(not hard to find someone kinkier than me) who was beyond shocked that I have never had oral or tried anal as the dominant(on top) or any form of bondage. She took me to a kink group where she introduced me as her virgin boyfriend since I had not had the normal experiences and after talking to the group about my experience or lack there of many of them said that they would consider me an adult male virgin and they were all very serious within saying so. 

We broke up and she said that she didn't want to end up marrying an adult male virgin anyways and I told her and her friends that I will just replace Steve Corelle in the next movie about a 40 year old dude and that would get rich from playing my true to life role and then end up getting a wife that appreciates me.

So there Y'all have it, my honest confession of being what some people would consider a real life 40 year old virgin/inexperienced man",0.55739564,0.15414265,0.11976352,1

113173509,reddit,offmychest,1762069307,"Stimfapping Addiction - Cocaine and Porn - A.K.A Living Hell

I’m sure I will labeled as a loser but I am 110% addicted to watching porn for days while binging a copious amount of cocaine.

When I was in college I started a studying for the GMAT and really started to hammer Adderral for the focus (I loved the euphoria more).  I would take  3 - 30mg (90mg) XR’s in one bite and I was zooming. I obviously was chasing the high and pretending it was helping me study. Unfortunately, one night, completely tooted, I was reading about exponets (algebra or whatever), got horny and thought I will go crank one out quick - 14 hours later and I found a new love. Stimulants and porn. That was the beginning. However, I managed to keep this “innocent” hobby under control since I had roommate’s.

Graduated college, 6 figure job right out, Adderall prescription, and a coke plug close and my life has gone to shit. I knew it was getting bad when I had no idea how much I’ve spent on blow - I finally looked at my statements - $21,000 this year. I go to a good amount of EDM shows and that is my self-deluded, bullshit excuse of why I justify the need to pick up 2 oz’s of coke. Knowing damn well the second I have one bump I’m in for 36 hours of straight porn. 

Last weekend, from Friday night to Monday morning 6:59 AM (Leave for work at 7 AM), I single handedly killed 16 grams of coke, then when I ran out, proceeded to gobble up my entire script of 30 30mg adderall xr’s. God damn I’m a genius, really making the family proud.

It was now Monday morning, and I’m hallucinating people from my work are in my apartment. Fully having conversations with them (nobody is in my apt, I am straight psychotic), talking about all kinds of things. Walked into the office that morning running around the building asking co workers why they were in my apartment. Somehow I came to the conclusion they were throwing me a surprise bday party (My birthday is 6 months away). Oh, and luckily I thanked my boss for cleaning the spiders I was hallucinating out of my sink for me and booking a 7 night cruise for my parents and friends that we all leave for that night. Fully psychotic.

Besides the occasional bag at a show, I truly have no interest in doing coke at all. When not on coke I don’t even watch porn. Mix the two of them and you have a whole separate drug on your own. That’s what I keep chasing, as pathetic as it is. Before people say, “dude just get some real girls”, the dopamine release when mixing stims and porn is so much greater then average sex. Unless having actual sex off stims, you can’t replicate it.

Lucky to be alive through all my binges and that it hasn’t completely destroyed my life. Truthfully, I am so far off the deepend with this educational and innocent hobby - I should be out a job and moved back in with my parents. I’ve had some lucky breaks. Hopefully this era ends soon.

Hey guys, I hope you’re all doing fine.
I just wanna talk about my situation right now. I’m 20 years old, and honestly, this is the worst period of my life. It started around two months ago, and everything keeps getting heavier.

I work and study at the same time, but I feel like I’m fighting alone. Even at home, we barely talk anymore. I keep thinking and wishing to punch the wall or anything around me,  sometimes even when I’m in the bus or any place, I just wish to punch the glass or something. In the changing room at work Or in my house or any place where no one can see me , because I can’t handle what’s inside me anymore. My hands are full of pain and marks because of it, but I can’t stop myself. I feel like I’m exploding from the inside.

What made it even worse is a girl from my job. I really liked her ,  she understood me, supported me, motivated me, and made everything easier. Even when I had big problems, she helped me get through them. To be honest, every man needs a girl like that. A girl can change so much in you , she can make you better, but she can also break you. But now she’s the reason it got worse, because she recently got engaged and will get married soon. And the hardest part is that I still see her every single day at work. I really needed her, and I wasn’t playing with her or anything. But she’s 2y older than me and wants something serious , and I’m still trying to build myself. That hit me so hard.

On top of that, I feel so anxious about the future ,  my goals, my dreams, my career, everything feels uncertain. I feel like I have no control over my life right now, and every small problem just makes it worse.

I stopped doing a lot of things. My prayers got weaker , not because I don’t want to pray, but because I feel completely drained. I ask Allah to forgive me. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, I never did any of that, but now bad thoughts come to my mind, and it scares me.

Is this normal? Is this depression or burnout or what? Because I can’t take this anymore. I just want someone to explain to me what’s happening, or at least tell me how to calm it down. Any advice or words from anyone who understands would mean a lot",0.14429577,0.030154925,0.024600167,0

This takes place about a year ago. With me (18m) my buddy, lets call him C (18m) and his girl, lets call her Z (18f)

C has been my best friend since we were in 5th grade, and I’ve had a crush on Z since we were freshmen in high school. C and Z ended up together, and they ended up moving in together after high school ended. 

I went over to their place last November to chill and have a good time, but something came up with Z’s sibling, so both C and Z took off and told me I could js stay there til they got back. 

But C ended up leaving his phone at the house, and Ik his password, so I decided to snoop. I ended up looking through his camera roll and found nudes of Z and a video of them going at it.

I decided to send the photos and video to myself, and when they got back to the house I pretended like nothing happened. 

When I got back to my place I did horrible things with those photos and video. It’s been about a year since that happened, and I’d like to think I’ve matured since then.

I feel nothing but shame for my actions, and the guilt I feel when they talk to me or invite me over eats me alive. I had a raging porn addiction for a really long time, so in my head it was no big deal to get these photos, because it was just more porn.

Once I quit porn entirely and just grew up I realized the gravity of what I did. I’m one of the reasons women are scared of men, and I’m not sure how to move forward. 

The pictures have already been deleted, and I’ve contemplated cutting them off entirely so I don’t have to tell them, but I know they need to know. I’m not looking for a pity party or anything of the sort, I’d just like advice on how I should move forward.",0.36095104,0.12159709,0.051580742,0

Because I was very depressed, I decided to try taking 40mg rather than the 30 to try and get back on track.. but I think it might have been a mistake? 
I have a headache now that really bothers me and I feel nauseous. 
It sucks but I’m not sure if the headache and nausea are from the Lenapro or from something else like my neck hurting?

Silent Thursday's Unexpected Gift


Silent Thursday, over—the labor done, the long shift finally through. The side-line work achieved, but only just; the effort left me blue. 

Yet, there's the meager prize: enough reward to tide me over for three, While the domestic pile looms large, demanding more and more of me.

 I'm running ragged, spent completely, exhausted down to the bone, When my phone lights up, a vibrant buzz, a message from the Great Unknown.

And then I read the words, an absolute, stunning, vibrant breach of sense: ""I found your personality... it's so addictive,"" stripped of all pretense. 

What the hell?! The utter shock! I stare; me, scattered, weary, and frayed? The person who sees this side of me, this messy, working-class parade? 

It's a bizarre, bright compliment thrown at the brink of utter collapse, A bewildering mirror held up, catching light in all the cracks and gaps!",0.06817148,0.028061481,0.005105704,0

Hello, first of all I’m sorry if I make some faults, English is not my first language. 
So I’m a 19 years old girl, I’m living with my sister and her boyfriend. It’s been like that for some times now cause my dad never been here for me, and my mom is in a psychiatric hospital, she’ll stay there forever cause she can never live on her own anymore. 

Last year I was in a nurse school, I’ve been bullied with friends and I couldn’t handle it so I quit. Right now I’m rotting at home, everyday I don’t do anything interesting except playing video games with friends. I’m doing homeschooling for being a webmaster now, but I don’t do all homework and I didn’t intend any virtual classes for a while now. I think I chose that because I didn’t wanted to go to school anymore cause I’m in depression and cause I fear other people a bit. Also, I’ve always had extreme social anxiety, but I made some effort for being a nurse cause I always wanted to help people. I used to love drawing so so much, now I stopped completely, I don’t enjoy doing it anymore and I hate what I draw. 

Recently, I’ve been feeling more and more useless and depressed in my life. I don’t have much friends in that city and they all are going to school and don’t have time so it makes me feel even more like a burden. We adopted a kitty, I asked for a cat and I love her, I thought that I’d feel better but I do not.

144088610,reddit,Anxiety,1762297927,"I've been dealing with air hunger consistently for the past several days. Any advice on how to deal with this?

Just for background context, I take several medications: Adderall 20 mg, Wellbutrin 150 mg, Prozac 20 mg, Xanax 0.5 (sometimes, not daily), and I started taking Vitamin D3 supplements that are 125 MCG about a month ago (I just saw today that's kinda considered too high a dose).

I stopped taking adderall today, because I assumed that was causing the feeling. It's been this never-ending feeling like I'm not getting a satisfying breath, so I yawn. I yawn so much that I almost fear it's hurting my throat in some way. I hear my jaw do the little ""pop"" from my mouth opening too much. But even today, without the adderall, I still have the air hunger problem. Took a 0.5 of xanax too, and I still have it. 

What do you think could be causing this? Also to note, I've definitely been snacking on Halloween candy, so maybe it has to do with the sugar intake recently? Maybe the other fact is that I haven't exercised enough recently. I feel like there are many factors, but I'm curious to see what any of you guys would think.",0.027677942,0.012870909,0.0031818156,0

Hello everyone, i'm reaching out here because i don't know what to do. I'm a 20 year old man, turning 21 next month and 2025 has been the hardest thing that i've ever experienced. I was always an energetic guy, i didn't like staying in, i loved communicating with people, i used to work out, but this year, i had some health issues, i quit the gym, gained 25 KGs (55lbs), i don't have a job and i can't get one, i have some financial issues which i can't resolve by myself, i don't know what i want, either to study or either to do. These past 6-7 months i stopped feeling like myself entirely, i don't wanna leave the house, i don't wanna talk to anyone and i mean anyone, not even my girlfriend, which i adore and i don't even know why she's staying with me because i don't treat her as well as i used to, but she's not even thinking about leaving me in this hard moment, i'm thankful for her, but i can't give out love now because i can't even look in the mirror without resentment. I don't do anything that i loved doing a year ago, or even 6 months ago, i don't even want to leave my room anymore. I can't afford a therapist (and don't get me wrong here, i'm just venting, i don't want anything except advice), and i don't want to talk about these problems with anyone because i don't know if anyone will get me, i don't want to blame these problems on anyone except me and it's turning into a spiral. I always loved dressing, smelling good, looking groomed and fresh and now i don't even care about that. Right now, i'm stuck and i'm in a spiral, i don't see myself in the mirror, i see someone completely different, not confident, which i used to be, not joyful and talkative, which i also used to be, i don't know if anyone will read this from top to bottom, but if anyone will do, i'll gladly accept some advice.

Hi everyone,
lately I’ve been dealing again with a kind of anxiety that I can only describe as “nervous system overdrive.”
It’s not a specific fear — it’s more like my whole system is running too fast:
constant fatigue, waking up early, racing thoughts, loss of appetite, dry mouth, frequent urge to pee, irritability, poor concentration.
My body feels like it’s on constant alert, as if something bad is about to happen, even though there’s no real reason for it.

I know there’s been a lot of stress recently: pressure at work and a baby on the way (our first child is due at the end of January ❤️).
It feels like everything has piled up in my head and my nervous system just got exhausted.

Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I’m genuinely curious if others have gone through these periodic “overdrive” phases — when all the anxiety symptoms hit at once even though, logically, you know there’s no real danger.

As a man / soon-to-be dad, do you have any good advice on handling the stress before the baby arrives?

Thanks so much in advance for any help or experiences you can share. 🙏",0.08320791,0.023866551,0.0053276913,0

When my wife and I first got married, we started our life together completely on our own. We had our first child, we were paying rent, bills, everything and I was the only one working.

There were times when we literally had just a few euros left in the house. And not once did she complain. Not once was she hysterical, angry, or bitter. She never blamed me, never put pressure on me. She understood the situation we were in and she saw that I was doing my best for our family.

Now, life finally changed. I had to leave to work in another country, but I earn much more. Everything is paid on time, I started building our home, and I can even pay for her education without stress.

And because of all this, I genuinely believe in the saying:

I’ve been struggling emotionally this year, and something from my past keeps coming back up. I’m trying to understand my part in it and whether I should still feel as guilty as I do.

A while ago, I was talking to a guy for a couple of months. When we first started getting to know each other, he introduced me to one of his friends. His friend started showing interest in me, and at that time I was in a really bad emotional place. I felt lonely and the attention made me feel wanted. Even though I was already seeing the first guy, I ended up getting involved with his friend too.

It didn’t take long before the guy I was originally seeing found out. He blew up on me. He called me names, cussed me out, and told me I didn’t respect myself. I felt like absolute trash afterward.

Later on, I found out that both of them actually had girlfriends the entire time. So while they were acting mad at me and judging me, they were literally cheating on their own partners. The hypocrisy still blows my mind.

What’s been weighing on me even more is something I only learned about afterward. The guy I was originally seeing recorded us during sex without telling me. He kept the video and showed it to people in my close circle once he found out about me and his friend. I had no idea he recorded anything until after it was already shared.

I know I made mistakes. I’m not pretending I didn’t. But I can’t tell how much blame I should carry for the messy relationship stuff versus how much of the guilt I’m holding that doesn’t actually belong to me. I keep going back and forth between feeling ashamed and feeling angry about how everything happened.

I’m just trying to understand my own responsibility in all of this and whether I’m being too hard on myself. I’d appreciate honest thoughts from anyone who’s been through something similar or has some perspective.",0.19029272,0.02708937,0.01565665,0

946678,reddit,offmychest,1761262621,"My childhood best friend's fiancé hates me for being with my boyfriend?

This is a large, long and tangled story, but I still can't let it go and I have no one irl that is not directly involved to talk about it with. I'll be glossing over A LOT cause this is so incredibly extensive and because almost everyone involved uses reddit.

To begin, I (20 afab) had a close friend at school from the ages of 11-16. He (I'll call him K here) and I were in the same friend groups throughout school and played a lot of video games together. I knew he had a crush on me when we were younger, but as we got closer at around 14 I realized those feelings were still there. 
I've always had low self esteem and got really wrapped up in the attention he have me, but after it went too far once I did tell him I didn't reciprocate his feelings. This did become a cycle though where I welcomed his attention in-between my short relationships, but shut him down again when I entered a new one. Yes this was so fucking mean of me, I know that now, at that time I was 15 and trying to navigate my own unstable mind, I also had to manage his. Because K was very obsessive and clingy to me, if I did  anything that he read as me being upset at him he could go so far as threatening to harm himself. (This happened more than once). So, when we changed schools for our equivalent of high-school, I made sure to take some distance to him to force him to make his own friends. Which actually went well. He pretty quickly found his now fiancé and her friend group, which he clicked with. I was so happy for him. 
I joined them quite often that first year, I got to know K's fiancé very well (I'll call her H from now on) and really liked her. But one thing led to another and in year two I got to know she still accociated with some people who were really shitty people, like tried to ruin another of my friend's lives (literally planned murder) and that she had made said friend pretty upset and uncomfortable. So I took some distance because I didn't know how to feel. 
A few months later I was dumped by a long term partner and was single ober the summer, right when we were about to start school again I realized that I had feelings for H's friend who were in their friend group. I took my time and talked to H, first to apologize for my behavior the past months and for not coming to her and actually talking about it before, and then about my feeling for our mutual friend. She made it clear that she didn't think it was a good idea to pursue him for multiple personal reasons, and I agreed with her. I wasn't going to pursue him, I just wanted to talk about my feelings. When school did start I couldn't hold it back though. So I told my now boyfriend about my feelings. A flip in H instantly switched. I texted her right after to say I fucked up, but also to make it clear to both her and my now bf that he didn't have to answer or reciprocate, I just needed to get it off my chest. But that didn't matter. H started ignoring us both, K did too, but only because whatever H says is law to him. I tend to ask H what was wrong, I tried to apologize again, but nothing got any other answer than ""it's fine"" or silence. My bf did slowly rebuild his friendship with her, but without me being mentioned. 
I have given up on rebuilding my relationship with her, but it still hurts to not know why even this all turned out this way. I want the connection we had back, but I try to console myself knowing she maybe isn't a great person. My bf and K are still great friends and it makes me kinda happy to know that K is okay and doing well, that's all I could've hoped for him and my bf is doing fine. 
Still feels really shitty knowing I'm the one who's lost the most...",0.17198499,0.04442204,0.033527173,0

I have been with my boyfriend for about a year and a few months. We see each other relatively often, about thrice a week, most of the time it’s just either of us staying over at either home. But I can’t help but think that he has been distancing himself more and more. Every time I ask him out on a date, he would either flat out reject, saying he’s lazy or he’s friends MIGHT ask him to hang on that day (they always ask of any random day of the week) which I feel is a bit weird because I asked first, but his friends’ possibility of inviting him out prevents him from going out with me. I’m not trying to alienate him from his friends btw. They hang out all the time, game all night in call and all that. I’m fine with him having friends I’m not evil. But I also notice he sometimes cancels our preplanned outings because something came up with his buddies. Is this brotherhood??? A weirder part of this story is that feel like his forcing me to be friends with his buddies’ gfs. Nothing wrong with those girls, they are lovely, but I don’t feel the need to be best friends with them. Sometimes it’s just hella uncomfortable. Then theres the late calls with his best friend. Recently, I came over to his house wanting to spend time with him, but he immediately hopped on his computer and was in game with his bff all night. Even after I fell asleep and woke up in the morning, I found him still on call. They were not in a game anymore, they were just chatting. And yea okay. chatting? thats not that bad. they have a naked pic of one another….  At the start of our relationship I was afraid of the girls he talks to. Now I’m even more afraid of the men.

Hi everyone,
There and a half years ago I was on vacation and I got hit while riding a scooter. I ended up injured and hospitalized. I recovered, but the experience stayed with me.

The problem is this: every time I’m about to go on vacation now, some coworkers make comments like “Well… if you come back this time,” or “Last time you ended up in the hospital!”

They say it jokingly, but it really affects me.
It makes me anxious before traveling and it brings back the fear from that accident.
I don’t know if I should speak up, ignore it, or explain how it makes me feel.

Has anyone gone through something similar?
How did you handle insensitive jokes about a traumatic event?

I would like to act and feel “superior” to all these (bastard) jokes and be confident. Maybe a part of me is worried it could happen again, or it’s just that I’m anxious and care way too much of others opinion..

72780241,reddit,offmychest,1761778422,"Does this count as cheating? Or am I being emotionally manipulated?

I’m a 26F and my husband is 30M.
We’ve known each other for two years and have been married for six months. Three months after the wedding, right when I found out I was pregnant, I discovered that he was messaging other women privately — almost on every social media platform.
There wasn’t any physical cheating or romantic talk, but the conversations were flirty and casual in a way that made me uncomfortable.

Of course, I was very upset and confronted him. He promised to change. But he did it again in the same month. When I brought it up, he turned the situation against me and said, “Why are you checking my phone?”
And yes, I know snooping is wrong, but my gut feeling was right — I only checked because I felt something was off.

Today, the same thing happened again. I found out he’s been chatting with another girl. I added her from my own account and messaged her directly — turns out, she knows my husband and his older (also married) brother, and both of them lied about being single.

Now I feel completely lost. I’m pregnant, and in my culture, divorce is complicated and not as simple as it is in Western countries. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t want to confront him again because I know he’ll twist things and make me the bad one, but at the same time, I can’t accept what’s happening.

I’ve thought of two plans:
	1.	Next week, we’re visiting our hometown to see our families. I’m thinking of staying with my parents and not coming back until he changes. If he doesn’t, then divorce will be on the table.
	2.	Or, I could do the same thing he’s doing — start chatting with other men as friends only, not romantically — just to make him feel what I felt, hoping that maybe then he’ll change.",0.14429577,0.061101943,0.024600167,0

359517432,reddit,offmychest,1763796376,"I Lost So Much to Mental Health and Agoraphobia and am Struggling to Get Back Up

Hey everyone, I just need to vent a bit. Some kind words, shared experiences, or advice would really mean a lot to me right now 💗

Growing up, I had a lot of blessings. I woke up to warm clothes, porridge for breakfast, and was driven to school. I got to do all the activities I wanted and had fun birthday parties. But even back then, I struggled with anxiety. I remember being no older than 7 and crying and screaming about going to school. The principal would have to come get me.

Around age 11 or 12, things started to get worse. I would have full-blown panic attacks in shopping malls, feeling like everyone was judging me, whether it was about my clothes or my hair. Looking back, it's hard to pinpoint why it started, since my childhood seemed so good overall.

By 15 or 16, things really started to unravel. I couldn’t keep a consistent sleep schedule, and getting up for school was a daily battle with my mom. Eventually, she couldn’t handle it anymore and sent me to live at my dad’s house. It wasn’t much, just a tiny room with a bunk bed and no internet. She was also juggling my sister, who was struggling too, and I think it all became too much for her.

I was constantly exhausted, overwhelmed by anxiety about school, and started coping with comfort eating. As a result, I gained a lot of weight. I found some escape and comfort online, mostly through Discord groups, where I met people who seemed like they understood me. But not all of them were good influences. Some were toxic, and they only made things worse by taking advantage of my vulnerability. I had some friends at school, but they didn’t understand what I was going through. My poor attendance and struggles made them turn on me at times, and I wasn’t always treated kindly. Eventually, I couldn’t handle it anymore, so I left school and finished that year online.

The next five years were a blur. I stayed in my room because I was too ashamed to leave. I remember trying to go out for Christmas dinner once and having to leave because I panicked. My anxiety was so bad that I had to count numbers in my head just to stay calm, but even that wasn’t enough. I felt horrible about my appearance, especially since I’d gained 10, 20, 30 kg. I missed so many important moments in my life because I couldn’t bring myself to leave my room.

During this time, I was also diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, and possibly Autism.

Fast forward to now, I'm 20, almost 21. I’ve lost the weight, but I still feel the aftermath of those lost years. I didn’t look after myself during that time. My teeth have erosion, I’m anemic, and my body shows signs of weight loss, especially around my chest. I feel inadequate when I look in the mirror. It feels like everyone else got to enjoy their youth while I was stuck in my own mind. And even now I still feel like I am struggling to pick up the pieces, I hate the scars that this battle has left me.

I haven’t seen a friend in years. I’m trying to re-enter education, but I feel like I’m so far behind and don't know what to pursue. It feels like I woke up from a five-year nap, and suddenly, I’m expected to be an adult with responsibilities. The world didn’t stop when I needed it to, and now it feels like I missed all the milestones, graduation, friendships, parties, learning to drive, the normal stuff that helps you transition into adulthood.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I know it’s a lot, but I appreciate any advice or shared experiences. ❤️",0.11078331,0.026960457,0.023796257,0

45332658,reddit,offmychest,1761568505,"I hate being lusted over and not loved.

This is just a rant.

I’ve(F24) been single for a while now

Maybe it’s because I feel lonely, or maybe I envy a lot of people in relationships because I just miss someone to love and be with.

I’m not saying I am the prettiest at all, I don’t like to be so high thinking of myself but men only see me as a total lust object.
They never seem that interested in my life, hobby’s or just me in general and when I think they do, it always just turns sexual to them and they want only one thing from me. I always shut it down real quick because that is not what I am looking for.

I have been on one date and that went south because he wanted to take things very quickly and well.
I just feel more of a trophy or thing to conquer than an actual person.

I just want to laugh, cry, and express myself with someone. Someone who sees me for me, in all my ways and not just for my looks.

And maybe this post is a bit egoistic and it’s such a whiny thing to do. Because who doesn’t want attention left to right?

My grandmother died a few weeks ago and right before she passed she dropped this bomb on us - the man I grew up calling grandpa isn't actually my biological grandfather.

She told us who the real one was but like, none of us had ever even heard this guy's name before. He wasn't some old flame or family friend or anything. Just some random guy she hooked up with back in the day. We were all kind of stunned but figured okay, maybe we can at least find out something about him or reach out to his family.

Turns out he died years ago. And his family? Yeah they want absolutely nothing to do with us. We tried reaching out and got basically shut down immediately. 

I don't really know what I expected honestly. They probably had no clue we even existed until we contacted them out of nowhere. Or maybe they did know and just never wanted anything to do with it. Either way it sucks.

The thing is, the man who raised my dad is still my grandpa. That doesn't change. But there's something weird about knowing there's this whole other side of my family out there and it's just a dead end. Like I have this biological connection to people who are complete strangers and fully intend to stay that way.

I guess I'm just venting because it's a mindfuck. My grandmother took this secret to her deathbed (literally) and now I know about it but there's nowhere to go with the information. It's just this weird empty space where family history should be.

406188366,reddit,depression,1764123867,"How to Stop My Suicidal Thoughts?

Not a day goes by where I don’t think about it. I have thought deeply into the logistics of how, where and when. Carefully crafting a way that would shield those I love from the moment it happens. People generally consider me to be the most positive and bubbly person in the room, but to my core I feel broken in a way that I fear can never be repaired. While I actively work to not let my childhood define my present, I come from a long lineage of deep addition, deaths and mental illnesses. The thought constantly lingers on my mind as if it’s a craving for a sweet. It’s always increasingly difficult around the holidays, but due to current life and critical financial issues, I feel like I’m barely hanging on. I’m scared to leave my friends and those who love me, but I’m exhausted by this life. I’m not sure I’ve ever felt true happiness or peace. Life has always felt like an uphill battle to death to me.

I used to work in property management. A group of early 20 year olds were frantic to find their missing roommate after he left a note. Eventually we found out he drove 1 hour north and jumped in front of a moving train. Less than 24 hours prior, he went grocery shopping and stocked his fridge full, accepted a new job and planned to exit his lease and move in with his new girlfriend. Outside of the obvious devastation for his family and roommates, my first thought was wishing him peace from the demons that carried him. My second, questioning the sudden nature of his decision, how long did it loom? My third thought, wishing I could do the same. The final, will I have a similar fate. Will these thoughts that have consumed me finally take over on a random Tuesday evening, even when my life was seemingly full?

As a young girl I didn’t “believe” in suicide. Even with the passing of my mother, active addition of my father and caring for my brother with a chromosome disorder, I robustly and vocally claimed it selfish. I couldn’t understand and deemed those individuals weak. Perhaps I’m too weak. I’m now freshly 29 and since my early 20s suicide has felt to be a part of my DNA. So much that I couldn’t conceptualize turning 30. As if the trauma of my ancestors finally caught up to me. Perhaps I manifested my own demise with this thinking.

Of note, I am not religious and have been to therapy. I pose this question in honest sincerity and not to receive pity. How do I stop this feeling that almost seems like fate? I feel peace with death. I don’t feel scared. If anything, it feels liberating to know I would indefinitely exit this world. I do feel scared to leave behind my friends and those who love me. Having experienced the reproductions of death, I know the pain that’s inflicted and I can’t bare the thought of harming them indefinitely.",0.112746716,0.022190686,0.012641981,0

I have been a long time sufferer of chronic anxiety and I have spent the last two years learning to cope and live with it. I’ve done therapy, a lot of habit building, and started medication about a year ago and it’s helped me immensely. 

Recently, my anxiety has hyper fixated on the idea of my boyfriend and I’s relationship failing/ending. Even though we have a totally healthy relationship and make each other extremely happy, my brain has all the sudden ran the constant thought through my head: “what if you guys aren’t ’meant to be’”

I’ve been redirecting it to more positive thoughts like “he loves you so much” “you guys have great communication” “you both enjoy similar things” and etc.

Normally, when I have anxiety like this I feel it in my stomach. I get an ache and the knot in my stomach, but recently my anxiety’s physical manifestation has moved to my chest. I feel like a have a weight on it and I have never had my anxiety feel like this.

12577924,reddit,offmychest,1761325783,"I don't know how to go back to normal with my best friend/ex after he hurt me

I (f22), have a best friend (m26), who I am having a bit of trouble currently navigating a normal relationship with. I apologise in advance for the long post.

We first met online in a Discord server in January of 2025, and we hit it off pretty quick, until he confessed his feelings to me romantically. I returned his feelings at the time, and we began a relationship, but unfortunately things deteriorated since then.

I have C-PTSD and a lot of difficulty forming deeper emotional connections, with a lot of triggers about certain things. I told him specifically that I like to have things be planned, and that I like to be prepared for situations, and how I absolutely hate it when people spend large amounts of money on me in general. I specified that I *need* to take things slow in relationships to feel comfortable, and I don't like it when things escalate too fast. And receiving any gift makes me feel indebted and inadequate of their investment in me, which I told him. I specifically mentioned for him to not spend large amounts of money on me and confided in him how hard it was for me to accept gifts, because my birthday was coming up when the first incident in our relationship happened and he wanted to get me a gift, but I specifically and in-detail told him I wasn't comfortable with large surprises.

He then called me one day in March to tell me he was currently in the airport, showing up in my town (we live on separate continents, so this wasn't a cheap expense) and was going to show up tomorrow. I panicked because I felt very unprepared for this, and he then told me he spend over $1000 to secure us tickets to a show I liked.

I know it seems like a non-issue to complain about someone buying you a nice expensive gift you would like, but suddenly showing up without even checking with me if I'd be okay with it and then doing something I explicitly said I wasn't comfortable with made me feel uneasy. I communicated to him that I wasn't comfortable with it and we moved on from it and things were okay again after that, and he said he'd refrain from spending too much on me until I was more comfortable, in the meantime me telling him I would just prefer he hugs me and spends time with me.

Then, a few months later, he visited again, which was planned, so I was more okay with it. Due to my trauma, I am usually wildly uncomfortable with anything of a sexual nature, and tend to experience dissociative blackouts (I'm diagnosed with a dissociative disorder), so I told him we would have to take it slow in that regard, which he said he was fine with. I told him that I needed him to always ask me before touching me in any way that could be construed as sexual, because otherwise, I'd just let him do whatever he wanted and not remember it afterwards because I'd dissociate through it. It was really important to me for him to remember that and always ask, because I genuinely just completely blank out during situations like that. He was fine asking for the first time and let me set the pace, but then stopped asking, and I blacked out during several encounters.

I felt really gross afterwards because I couldn't remember what happened, and I spoke to him about it, and he was apologetic.

He has BPD, so I've been there for a lot of his emotional breakdowns and talking him down from doing something harmful. It's been hard to voice things that upset me, because even in the above examples he'd start to talk about how he deserves to die and is unlovable even whilst I try to reassure him. It's hard to find the space to tell him when something he does upsets me, because then it turns into me having to talk him down from a spiral that I caused by expressing something he did that hurt me.

It's already pretty hard for me to confide in people, because I've had abusive parents and CSA trauma, as well as being autistic and experiencing a lot of bullying in adolescence. I withdrew from venting about my emotions, too, because if I spoke about feeling really depressed one day he'd start talking about how worthless he is for being unable to help me and then instead of having a safe place to talk about my feelings, I'd have to reassure *him* that he wasn't worthy of death for the way that I feel.

We met again for a convention in August, which was the most recent time we met. We had decided to cool it on the relationship aspect and try to return to being friends, because we have mutual friends we hang out with during these conventions and we *started* as best friends, and didn't want to lose each other. He had another few episodes whenever I'd talk to our mutual friend, which made things uncomfortable, but he acknowledged that it would be toxic to expect me to not talk to our friend.

We're planning on all hanging out again in December, but things are becoming kind of awkward. I don't know how to return to a regular friendship with him.

I hate myself for how I don't feel safe around him anymore after the stupid dissociative episodes, because I feel disgusted in myself that I did things I don't remember and I'm still upset with him that he deliberately went against things I asked for to feel comfortable, when he said he understood my triggers and was okay with how sensitive I was around these things.

He keeps telling me about the nightmares he has because he feels so guilty about hurting me, but I don't want to think about it anymore and just want to go back to being best friends. I don't know how I'm supposed to react when he goes off about his guilt, because I shouldn't have to apologise for getting upset when I gave him instructions on what to do to not trigger me. He said he did all he did because he cares so much about me, but that rings hollow when he didn't listen to what I told him was important to me.

How am I supposed to reassure him that he's worthy of love and that I still want to be his friend when I'm the focus of what he feels he did wrong? Am I even valid for being upset at these things? I know its not normal or the average dating experience to go into traumatic flashbacks and dissociative blanks whenever things get too stressful, and that it makes things way more difficult. He reassured me he was okay with all of that though and would be okay to handle it, because he does work as a psychotherapist specifically in trauma.

There are just moments when I really don't know what to do. I don't know how to stop feeling hurt and gross for the things that happened, and I don't know what to say when he starts to talk about how worthless he is and for how much guilt he feels. It feels like a trapped circle, and we have mutual friends so I can't cut him off, nor do I want to. I really do love him and don't want him to suffer, but I don't know how to go forward.",0.16678599,0.030044744,0.018269362,0

This my first post on reddit ever and after doomscrolling for a bit and not breaking no contact I decided to just, let it out here.

I (21M) got broken up with my ex (20F) roughly 3 months ago, ever since then I've decided to try and heal from her, I don't hate her or anything, I'm just sad and disappointed on how she broke up with me, granted I caused the argument and I take full responsibility for that, I tried to apologize to her and offer her an Uber to take her back to her friends hangout but she kept declining and continued the argument, but that's not what this post is about. I'm just confused, on one hand I'm angry, sad and disappointed on how she broke up with me (TLDR yelling yelling, she was trying to take her promise ring that i got her off, i tried stopping her, i got kicked in the chest) and I guess I have every right to since I did get kicked in the chest, on the other hand I still care about her, I still yearn for the version of her that was so kind, understanding and a good person.

I'm not claiming to the victim here, far from it, if I didn't start that argument over something stupid as her accidentally leaving her phone at home then this wouldn't have happened, but I'm just confused on how I feel, she doesn't occupy my mind as much anymore, but sometimes it feels like I'm back at that night, crying my eyes out in my room, on other days I feel great and not giving a damn.

Healing sucks and I kinda know im on the right path by doing my own thing and improving the quality of my life, I guess I just wanted somewhere to vent without being known.

Point is, I have mixed feelings on one hand I'd take her back if she does come back, on the other I don't want her back, we've broken up twice before this, it sucks, I hate it so much that she was my first gf and I had to get heartbroken to be better, that's on me. I do miss her and at the same time I don't want to hear anything she's been doing while I've been gone from her life.

She also took the pet cat I bought with her too so that sucks even more.",0.11140333,0.029053112,0.01565665,0

Sorry for the protracted history lesson, but it's generational trauma that's bothered me for much of my life now. My family traces their roots to Bulgaria and Armenia, both countries overrun by the majority-muslim ottoman empire. My ancestors were robbed, tortured, and genocided, and you still hear how many people today (especially in Turkey) continue to deny the atrocities that happened to my ancestors.

My Bulgarian ancestors spent 5 centuries under ottoman slavery, while ancestors to my Armenian side of the family... well read about what the Ottoman empire did to them in 1915, and what many modern Turkish people ignore and deny when they talk about how great the Ottoman empire was or how peaceful their religion is.

Two days ago, I broke down crying after hearing about a documentary film out of Turkey that essentially romanticized and glorified the Ottoman empire as some inclusive multicultural state. It was not. It was murderous and genocidal, and please don't pretend otherwise. Even more horrifying was that in Turkey there's also a museum literally dedicated to blaming Armenians for being exterminated under the bloodthirsty ottomans.",0.25462922,0.082619295,0.28034934,0

Every moment of pleasure is bought with way more pain, every achievement just reveals how hollow it all is, and even if you got everything you wanted you&#039;d just be bored as fuck, which is somehow worse than suffering. Death is the only real peace, complete annihilation where nothing can hurt you anymore because there&#039;s no &quot;you&quot; left to hurt. The universe itself is literally grinding toward non-existence, everything is slowly dying, and that&#039;s the point. We&#039;re all just consciousness trapped in this meat prison suffering because we&#039;re afraid to admit we actually want it to end. The truly enlightened move is recognizing that oblivion isn&#039;t something to fear, it&#039;s the goal, the finish line, the only real freedom from this joke of an existence. Fighting death is just cope, clinging to suffering because we&#039;re too scared to admit it&#039;s all meaningless. Embrace the void, anons.",0.8252207,0.5130944,0.28034934,1

M27 Indian.  Some part of me wants to give up. Give up on life altogether.. I don't feel happy anymore at all. I am single. Unable to find any girl for relationship. My female colleagues don't give a damn about me. I have been bullied in office. I don't understand how could I get bullied at age 27. My career progression is not so high. I hardly save any money. I am not doing gym anymore. I don't have good diet. In morning when I wake up, I feel like not doing something. My full house is infested with mosquitos, bugs, lizards and specially cockroaches. They make my life so hell. I don't get enthusiastic about anything anymore. I sometimes am unable to understand what type of daily life I am living without upgrading.

248621942,reddit,depression,1763035660,"Socially awkward.

I am a 43 year old man. Full time job. Good looking to some ugly af to others. I have overshared which makes people come back years later and use what i shared with them against me.

I just ran a marathon and though a friend flew up to cheer me on and my girlfriend was there it seemed like no one gave a fuck. I say no one as in social media but overall i always say i have no friends or that i am a solo act. I learned through my 20’s and 30’s that most people i grew up with did not like me. They just hung out with me because thats what you did with the people you grew up with. I began something in my life called “the great extraction” meaning all the former friends that took advantage of me or that acted weird around me were removed from my life. I did alot of extracting. But as i maneuver through life after these extractions i experience awkwardness all around me. People feeling uncomfortable around me. Its alot sometimes and it constantly goes through my head like damn, am i the most hated person i know? I read if people are awkward around you that means they are jealous but its the wildest ways they are awkward. Like for example, this couple at church. We all knew each other as kids. On palm sunday a few years ago i asked the husband to make me a cross out of palm. Dude panicked. Like i’m busy, i can’t, i wont be able to. I’m like thats cool man. Chill out. Next thing i know everytime i saw him after that he avoided me like the plague. Because i asked him to make me a cross. Lol. When i tell these stories to myself i always ask myself ‘what am i missing?’ Because why are these people treating me like a criminal. Another story i have recently is some dude i have overshared with but never really spoke to. I knew him from church and we grew up moved different places and found each other on facebook. We spoke on the phone and when we spoke i was so depressed and i was throwing up from the mouth. Told him no one hangs out with me, i have no friends etc. this guy lives in florida and about 6 months after this phone call i planned with him that i’ll be visiting florida and i’ll contact him when i’m out there. When i got out there i contacted him and he made up an excuse that he was busy and could not meet up. I immediately knew he was lying because he was stuttering during his delivery and i know he works from home so he dud not have to do much but open his door and greet me. So i stopped contacting him. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, i texted him (along with a few others) on how to track me during the marathon. He never replied. When i completed the marathon he texted me “hope you finished” so anyone that knows me knows language is important to me so ‘hope’ seemed like you might not finish but i hope you do. So i responded with ‘i finished, dick.’ Its a playful response that could have been replied to in an equally similar way. His response 7am the next day? That i am narcissistic and never to contact him again. No wonder i have no friends and no one likes me and i have no relationships. That made me laugh initially because thats how i speak. He took my exact words from 2 years ago and used them against me. I brushed it off went on vacation and returned. I dont know why and i regret doing so but i texted him that he can’t even spell narcissistic. He replied to go fuck myself, to stop harassing him, and never to contact him again. I do feel everything he said was a direct response to what i confided in him 2 years ago. But theres more some people i work with avoid me at all costs, both my brothers have not spoken to me in years. Its a mind fuck. As far as myself i am funny, intelligent, can be an asshole at times but its all in fun. I am not mean in any way. I mean no harm. But life is tough. I have a girlfriend but she seems tired of me. I live at home with parents though i do own property. But what these interactions do is simply make me quiet. I dont engage and i just stay quiet. It sucks and everytime i feel i am beating this depression thing it comes back in these awkward interactions.",0.4398409,0.25998658,0.053399716,0

137618935,reddit,offmychest,1762234240,"My father cheated on my mother

My dad recently left my family. My mom has been trying to get him to come back, likely due to a mixture of financial reasons, my sister being very young, and the fact that they’ve been together for almost 30 years. My parents have always had a tumultuous relationship, and growing up my mom was emotionally and sometimes physically abusive towards me. My father stepped into a kind of protective role towards me, so he was the only parent I really relied on and saw as kind of a savior figure. About a month ago he finally got fed up with my mom’s behavior and left. Yesterday I heard them arguing on the phone, and my mom said, “Do you remember cheating on me?” This was never something I had ever expected. I always thought of my parents as loyal to each other, despite their toxicity. They have four children together. I don’t know anything else, like the details, the timeline, anything. I’m assuming it happened a really long time ago, but it’s still flipped my world upside down. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should tell my mom that I know, or if I should tell my siblings. My dad keeps texting me and asking me to meet up or come over to his new place. I don’t really know where to go from here and just needed to get it off my chest. Obviously I’m going to be getting therapy, but yeah.",0.22311419,0.076819435,0.031722516,0

I just had to write this out and maybe then I can figure out how I feel. I have feelings for my best friend, I’ve had these feelings for years.

I’m a 31f, but I’ve always struggled holding friendships for a multitude of reasons. But this relationship I had to end in the past because I was still very in love with this person. Anyway fast forward and we are friends again and I tell him how I feel, he doesn’t feel the same which is fine I mostly told him to just get those feelings off my chest. But they are still ever there, ever present. I can’t stop thinking about him. I wish I didn’t anymore because I know it isn’t healthy. And he’s obviously pulling away being I’m being too much again.

I finally moved to a new city in July. I spent years in my former city, miserable, feeling like total shit. Yes, I did/do have friends, but the city was draining, and I felt unsafe. I had to move.

Well, I've moved. My new city is wicked! I love it here! But I've recently felt so burnt out...

Finding a job here is almost impossible. The only places that are hiring, are places that I'd never work. I'm not knocking those jobs, I just know that I can't do them.

Moving into my new place was a long and stressful process. I cried over and over before the move, and I've broken down afterwards. It's been so hard finding a new place for everything, painting and decorating, etc. I thought this was meant to be fun? I've been here 3 months, and there's still bags and boxes everywhere. I just don't have the energy to paint and decorate, put shelving up, and put those items away.

I just thought that I'd be better by now. It's been 3 months. How am I still so exhausted? It's not like I have a job to do. Unemployed, struggling to find work, living in and out of boxes and bags. I'm so tired.

I'm not looking for advice, especially when it comes to employment. I don't want a support group, none of that circle therapy stuff. I just want to vent.

1128290,reddit,offmychest,1761082908,"I long for and am terrified of physical contact/intimacy

I’m a 31yo male who has been divorced for almost 3 years now. I’ve been working on myself and I’m at a point where I’m comfortable alone but I want badly to be intimate with a woman again. It has been 2 years since the last time I was with a woman, it was amazing honestly the best sex I’d ever had! It was good for both of us as we both finished multiple times and cuddled after. But I was not in a good spot mentally I think because I immediately “fell in love” with her after and we specifically talked about how that’s not what we wanted and that I wouldn’t do that. Anyway, due to that and other circumstances stances I decided I would be celibate for a while, I’m very happy I did honestly. But here’s the thing I have inadequacy issues, I was sexually abused and beat up a lot as a kid, as a teen I was cheated on by a few girlfriends, they made fun of my size and duration to rub salt in the wound after. When I got with my now ex wife I went to great lengths to learn how to please a woman because I didn’t want her to be unsatisfied, well she ended up cheating on me with a girl, her best friend, I tried killing myself that night and they found me in the bath tub. Blah blah blah, divorce. I’ve tried super hard to get over these feelings but it’s always there. If I talk to a woman I like or think is very attractive I immediately think of how I should stop because I’m not worth it and I’ll just let them down. I know if it even gets there I’ll start thinking about how they think I’m not big enough or my body is gross or I moving wrong and then I can’t get hard and if I do I can’t finish and the woman thinks it’s their fault and I feel bad. My dick isn’t even small, I don’t know why I can’t stop, I know I’m good at head, but I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s like with my ex I thought I was satisfying her but I obviously wasn’t, the girl I last slept with said it was great but in my head I know she’s was lying. I almost hate sex because you get naked and then just smash you privates together, I’ll complement there body and tell them how good it is (if I wasn’t enjoying it I just stop now and give up) and they’ll just say “thanks” or something and I’m like dude I must really suck, it’s almost as if when I sleep with a woman they just want it over with asap and they regret it. Honestly I would too. It’s all in my head and it never stops. I used to not be like the is but everything just hit me at once and now I feel broken. I don’t want to masturbate anymore because if I think of myself with a woman I’ll think “this would never happen she’d laugh at me and be disgusted by me” and I stop. I had a “sex” dream the other night and I couldn’t get hard and then the girl got mad at me and I cried then she said I was gay. IN MY F’king DREAMS! I had to get this off my chest I’m to scared to talk about it with anyone besides my therapist and I just want someone to talk to about it.",0.36095104,0.04090862,0.049989145,0

I need to put this somewhere because I’ve been carrying it around for too long. I’m ashamed of how many chances I gave my ex — I’ll call him Sebastian — despite everything that happened.

We met in a mental hospital. After we were discharged, things went downhill quickly. He got kicked out by his adoptive mom. I got kicked out shortly after and lost my job. We both ended up staying with a mutual friend, and from there our situation kept getting more unstable. We went through periods of homelessness, constant moving, and nonstop stress.

Sebastian had severe mood swings. He would go from calm to yelling within seconds. He screamed at me in public, interrupted any attempt I made to talk, and blamed me for things I had no control over. Eventually, the verbal and emotional abuse turned physical — moments that left me genuinely scared of him and scared of what would happen next.

He manipulated me, played hot and cold, and made me question every decision I made. I spent most of the relationship walking on eggshells because I never knew when he would get angry again. When he got new friends, he ignored me completely, and I felt invisible in the same spaces we were supposed to share.

Through all of this — the instability, the yelling, the physical, verbal, and emotional abuse, the neglect, the manipulation — I stayed. I kept hoping he’d change, or that things would calm down. I kept giving him chances he didn’t earn.

I’m ashamed of how long it took me to leave, and of how much of myself I lost in the process. After 2 years, im finally being honest about what our relationship was…",0.121732734,0.04969218,0.010063417,0

the pain isnt even the worst part, its feeling like i'm trapped in my body. i can't do any of the things that help my depression and even when i start feeling better my pain meds wear off and remind me of the active torture i'm facing. what makes it even worse is that my twin sister moved out a few months ago and i have about 5% of the emotional support i used to have. i just feel like life just keeps getting harder every single day. this month alone i was in a car accident, missed my LSAT ($300 down the drain), got $500 stolen, and broke my playstation. i seriously don't know how to relax at this point. i'm going through some major cabin fever and i don't know how i'm gonna stay sane.",0.20172562,0.05086332,0.011469335,0

Relevant information: my pronouns: he/him im autistic, diagnosed with level 2 asd, im almost certain i have some kind of adhd, and im trans

Also trigger warning: self harm and suicide

Evertime i talk about doing schoolwork or rewatching a class or doing a test i get an anxiety attack, everytime i attend one of my classes (i do it via a teams call) i disassociate for the entire hour, everytime i think about school it just makes me want to hide. I dong want to go back to school. I havent been doing it, because of whats been going on in my family recently (my mum attempted suicide, my parents are breaking up, im staying at my aunts house with my dad), but now my dad wants me to get back into it, but i just cant convey to him the dread and anxiety it fills me with, it makes me want to hurt myself again, it makes me want to do something horrible to myself so that i get more time away from it, it just makes me feel the worst ive ever felt. Is this trauma? The last three years have not been good schol wise, my first high school, had nice teachers but was so under funded, they didnt even have a room i could sit to calm down/anyone who could really help, and it just made me feel so helpless, my second high school, was a private school, so it had better funding, but the teachers were awful. They treated me like an alien tbh, they told me anytime i feel overwhelmed i can sit outside at this table, that i hated, but was the least bad out of my options, and i didnt move from that table all year, i was always overwhelmed, and it was so so terrible for my mental and physical health. Now im doing online school, which is better because i dont have to talk to people, and i can be alone, but it still makes me so incredibly anxious. Even typing this all out ive started crying, cause it makes me feel so scared, and i can never actually pay attention. I dont like my teachers, and out of the friends ive made there, theyve made me feel invalidated in certain ways. I definatly felt the worse at the second school, none of the others actively have made me want to take my life like that hellhole did (ironic, calling it a hellhole, cause it was a christian school.) Its weird, cause i don't think ive processed that anything in my life has been trauma, and it feels like, ""well every kid hates school, your not traumatised!"" But everytime i think about it i go so quiet, and i start having an anxiety attack and feeling all the things they made me feel again. Its hard to describe, cause at this point i cant tell if im exaggerating or not when i say some of these things. I feel like im being dramatic, and every kid goes through this, but i just feel so utterly hopeless when i even think about school, let alone actually going back",0.19870108,0.06023245,0.10221587,0

69384,reddit,depression,1761006963,"Por que sinto que a vida não vale ser vivida.

Não sei de qual maneira poderia começar o post então vou introduzir um pouco de minha pessoa, me chamo Breno, tenho 20 anos, nascido e criado no RJ, sempre tive uma vida tranquila, nunca me faltou nada porém nunca tive nada em excesso, nunca dei muita importância pros meus estudos mas também nunca fui tão burro, quando cheguei no 1° ano do ensino médio notei que eu era um pouco diferente das pessoas que estudavam comigo entretanto nunca me parei pra pensar o motivo disso e nem como se sentiam em relação a isso.

Sempre fui uma pessoa boa, tive muitos amigos e falava com todos, só que em diversos momentos do dia eu sentia uma melancolia tão forte, um sentimento de não pertencer a nada e só queria deixar de existir, e esses pensamentos foram corroendo minha mente, diversas vezes estava conversando feliz com meus amigos e do nada eu fechava a cara e ficava no meu canto infeliz com tudo.

O tempo passou e fui aprendendo a ""controlar"" mais esses episódios, mas não é porque eu aprendi a controlar que eles deixaram de existir, quando completei 18 anos me alistei no exército e servi no ano de 2024, foi o maior tapa da realidade que eu tomei na minha vida até então, era um sonho, servir e proteger, sempre tive esse sentimento de querer ajudar, ser útil, pertencer alguma coisa, porém como sabemos o nosso exército não é flor que se cheire, e passei por um dos piores momentos da minha vida, onde eu vivia exclusivamente pro exército, não tinha um dia de serviço que eu não pensava em pegar a minha arma e acabar com isso ali mesmo, mesmo pensando nisso sem parar eu nunca criei coragem e sinto que até hoje não teria pra fazer tal coisa.

O tempo foi passando um pouco mais e consegui marcar um psicólogo pelo quartel de forma gratuita, infelizmente acabou não dando em nada pois eu acabei saindo do exército e eles não iriam cobrir mais as minhas consultas.

Fiquei um tempo só existindo em casa, afinal ainda iria continuar recebendo um salário então dava pra ficar tranquilo por um tempo, tava com um shape bacana, dinheiro e mesmo assim esse sentimento nunca me abandonou por 1 dia sequer.

Alguns meses depois de sair do exército tive o primeiro baque da minha vida, descobri que tinha tuberculose, sempre fui muito saudável, fazia bastante exercício físico, gostava de estar sempre em movimento, logo no mesmo dia que descobri a doença tive que ficar em isolamento e foram os piores dias da minha vida, tossia sangue sem parar e achei que a minha vida iria acabar ali mesmo.

Nesse instante eu fiquei com medo de saber que poderia acabar ali e eu não teria o controle disso, saber que poderia morrer sem realizar nada, afinal a gente nunca está pronto pra morte, me sentia em uma batalha constante do meu corpo contra a doença, foi uma semana infernal tossindo sangue sem parar e achando que poderia morrer a qualquer momento, sou uma pessoa de altura mediana, possuo 1,80m e a minha média de peso é algo entre 73kg - 76kg, cheguei a perder 16kg em algumas semanas, batendo 60kg e ficando extremamente magro, após esse episodio eu passei a dar um pouco mais valor a vida.

O tempo passou e cá estamos, 2 meses de tratamento e sinto que o sentimento de não querer existir me persegue, mesmo passando por tal situação a vontade de querer estar vivo durou no máximo 1 semana e agora eu me pego pensando por que eu me sinto assim, por que eu simplesmente não posso ser feliz por estar vivo ? eu não vejo um futuro pra mim, não me imagino velho e todo dia me vejo pegando uma faca e simplesmente enfiando na minha barriga, sei que não me mataria, apenas penso nisso.

Além disso tudo acabei enfrentando a dura realidade que eu tenho EP, não das piores mas que com certeza afeta muito minha auto estima, afinal o homem que não confia nas suas próprias capacidades não tem muito o que oferecer para outras mulheres, sempre fui um cara muito desenrolado e nunca gostei de pegar muitas mulheres, justamente por isso demorei pra descobrir que enfrentava esse problema, atualmente estou gostando muito de uma garota e isso me afeta bastante.

Apenas um simples desabafo, queria saber se alguma pessoa compartilha de alguma experiência parecida e o que fazem pra evitar esse tipo de coisa.",0.17545098,0.0808917,0.017063495,0

I was 12. I think. Maybe a year younger, but I don't believe a year older, but I suppose it's possible. My victims were my step brother and an old friend of mine. The event with my brother significantly worse.

I also have a hazy memory of almost perpetuating the abuse on that same friends much younger sibling. I am almost certain that I didn't follow through, and it was just a thought at the time, but I can't guarantee anything based on my loose memory.

If it matters, I was also a peeping tom.

I... Don't really know how to process all this. Especially the one against my brother, it was especially messed up.

I don't remember having a history of sexual abuse in my childhood, though, to be fair, I don't remember much about my childhood before the age of 10...

I know I'm going to get ripped to shreds. I [31M] don't expect any sympathy. I've been trying to prepare myself mentally before I tell my wife [28F].

I lost both of my jobs at the end of July. I was overemployed and she didn't know. Somehow my original job found out. I was a civil servant and they didn't like that I was working another full time job. They notified the company where I was working my second job as well. Even though I always got all my work done during the day I was dismissed from both jobs. I don't know what I was thinking. I just told her I got promoted at my (original) job and that's what the extra money was. I never ended up telling her I got dismissed.

She's a solicitor and she doesn't work remotely at all so it was easy to pretend I was still working every day. I took loans to cover my missing income. I have been desperately looking for another job but haven't been successful. Now it's all fallen apart and there's no way for me to hide it anymore. We've been married for a year (and together for a total of 4 years). I love her more than anything but I know she's going to be furious. I don't even know why I did what I did.

So, in our course we have to form groups of 5. My friend, A, and I along with 2 of his friends are in the same group, say group X. Two guys who want to join X asked if I wanted to join group Z. Group Z is 3 girls who I don’t know + 1 who I don’t really get along with. 

I really want to stay in my group. But A doesn’t really seem to want me in this group, he prefers the other guys. So, I contacted other groups and they said they were full. I also made suggestions on how to balance these 2 groups better but Z wants it to be just me. 

In the end, I thought, “why is this pinned on me? I joined X first. It isn’t up to me to rearrange everyone just because 2 boys won’t split”. And I sent this to A. But he still insists the easiest way is for me to join Z. 

I know it is. But it isn’t fair to me. I might be selfish but aren’t the 2 guys more selfish? They both are late, they don’t get to make the shots. Just split and join each group.

I don't necessarily know what a good person is, I just know it's not me. I feel like every opportunity I've had to make a mistake, I've taken. My ex was probably the best thing that ever happened to me, or will ever happen to me, but then again I don't know, in fact as I type I begin to realise I know very little at all. All I know is it shouldn't take 3 years to find some relief from unreciprocated love. I don't blame her for not loving me, I'm far from sane and I treated her like shit, I just want some closure. We spoke a couple months ago, she's pregnant to the guy I told her would fuck her and leave her when she gets pregnant and look at that she's pregnant and alone. What I don't understand is why I can't escape this. Almost every night for a year I would stalk her socials, not harass her, but definitely stalk her, then it became harassment, and then I stopped because things got out of hand. I finally stopped thinking about her this year, finally found the courage to burn the birthday cards and the polaroids and the clothes I'd kept in a box this whole time thinking she'd be back. Then she fucking calls? Calls me, pregnant, and flips my entire shit upside down. I wanna hate her, but I know this isn't her intention. She doesn't want me to be obsessed with her but its like some exterior force does, every time my mind wanders away from her something puts me right back there, maybe its karma but I was never much of a spiritual type so idk. I cheated, I lied, I manipulated and dictated, and I wish I had the balls to just string myself up because I don't know how to forgive myself for losing her and I don't know how to live without her. I don't function anymore. I'm about to lose my job and the debt collectors are due to come knocking. I don't know how much longer I can do this.",0.17025198,0.04149419,0.030175667,0

Hey everyone, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 5 years ago, but it goes way back. Also ADHD since childhood, I'm taking meds and getting better for the last few months because I found meds that works for me (which I wish for all of you), but there is something haunting me inside.  


I used to trust my intelligence and memory but for the last 5? years it's just not there. Friends or family tells a story, I don't remember it, they get into details, I suddenly start remembering it. But only the things they tell me, I can't continue the story on my own. It's like my brain locked my memories and I can't access them by my will.

I also can't remember my duties, forgetting where I put things, placing the ice in the drawer and the fork to the freezer etc. I do these by instinct and the moment I do it, I snap out of it and can't believe myself for being this stupid. Same thing with intelligence.

I feel like I don't belong in this form of mine, it's a ""residue"" of me. I don't know if I'll ever be ""myself"" again, or even close to it, or how.

Ironic. I blame myself for everything, yet I miss me the most.

If you've gone through similar things and actually got better, I would really appreciate some advice.

  
TL;DR: My mind is slow and blank and I don't know what to do because it was a big part of me and I'm afraid it's gone forever.",0.08241652,0.025800243,0.01565665,0

TL/DR: I’m tired. And anxiety is a real bitch. 

I am a woman in my 50s with a great job, great family and a great group of friends. I have so many people who love me and think I’m amazing. And yet—I feel like I’m faking it. Nobody knows how much I am struggling and I don’t feel like I can tell anyone because I don’t want people in my world to worry. So many people depend on me and I can’t be falling apart. 

I have lived with anxiety my whole life and have had major bouts of depression too. I’ve never actually attempted suicide but I’ve come close. For about the past 12 or so years I’ve been doing really well. Found meds that work and I’ve been living authentically and have let go of past fears.  But recently, it’s just all come rushing back and I feel like I’m drowning. I had a major panic attack last week (first one in years) and it was so bad I took myself to the hospital. I couldn’t function. I was crippled by it. And for the first time in years I felt like I just didn’t want to be here. I got through it as one does but that feeling of…I don’t know…blech? It’s just been simmering below the surface. And once again I’m currently panicking and just wanting this to be over. I’m fighting it and I won’t harm myself but damn it’s so exhausting.

Hi! This is all about the passing of Emman A. 

I dont know but it strike me so hard. one side of my family also has mental health problems and suicide deaths.

About Emman, I feel the deepest sympathy for her family. I cant imagine what was she thinking before and during that time. Im so scared. Im crying. Im so devastated for whats happening right now. This is not because of the same experience I had as Emman, but you’ll see how she was so jolly, sporty, friendly, and even so pretty. But all of these were nothing compared to depression. 

I watched her bouldering videos and inspired me to do sports - I also wanted to try bouldering but idont have any friends to go with. 
She was so young. I cant imagine the pain she had to go through.

For me, I have generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and adult separation anxiety. 

I excessively worry about things in day to day life, examples being a car crash, someone im close to passing, etc. Honestly though my generalized anxiety is not that bad and really doesnt hinder my day to day life unless it is triggered by my other anxietys.

Social anxiety is my first anxiety I noticed. I hate talking on the phone with a passion, I have almost never answered the phone to anyone that isnt immediately family, i also rarely even make calls unless I have no choice. I am also scared about using a card at a store, because im bad at it and its humiliating. (Ive been given small things for free because of this, and I cried after) I barely had friends in school, and family gatherings are very hard for me. I also skipped school a lot because of it and skipped classes I would have to present something. BUT, ive learned to pretend it doesnt exist, if I dont think and just do immediately when my fear kicks in it gets worse. 

My adult separation anxiety is the worst. It triggers the worst of my generalized anxiety. I have an irrational fear of my sisters, but especially my twin sister dying when I am not around. I have never been able to hold a job for more than a day that wasnt from home. While at work I start thinking about the precious time im wasting being away from her, and thinking what will I do if she passes away and im not there. These thoughts spiral into “if I dont stay at work im failing my siblings, my family who knows about this jobs, etc.” I degrade myself thinking im a failure and capable of nothing but taking up space and my siblings money. I always have mental breakdowns after I attempt a job, my longest lasted 8 hours straight of sobbing and going back in forth “be strong, you can do this -&gt; no you cant, you cant get a job,” and repeat. 

Anyways, what about you? (:",0.06579731,0.022899706,0.003607291,0

Title says it all. My mother berated at me for being in therapy for 6 years and still being weak and pathetic. I'm starting to feel like maybe I'm not cut out for this world anymore. Why is it not enough? Why am I not enough? Am I just a mistake? Should I just run myself over? 

I don't know if I'm meant for this world. I have nothing to live for. I'm a 25-year-old gay guy with a lousy Bachelor's degree in English, yet I'm working at an AMC movie theater with low hours and on minimum wage. 

I am ashamed that I am not enough for my mother, who wishes she had a better stronger son. She is sad that she has to lie to her friends about my career because she does not want to be embarrassed to tell them that I work at a minimum wage job despite being a college graduate. I am sad that I can't make her proud. 

  
I want to go back to school to get my Masters in education and my teaching credential, but I don't feel like I can handle it. I am so lousy in that I am always anxious about anything challenging. 

I think about self-harm on the daily. I am shocked that I am still here despite my daily suicidal thoughts. 

Should I keep going? Is therapy a waste of time, according to my mother? Am I enough?

Hey everyone,

I've struggled with anxiety for years, and one thing I noticed is that most ""coping strategies"" feel like they require too much energy when I'm actually anxious. Like, I can't do a 20-minute meditation when I'm spiraling.

So I created something gentler-a printable zine with tiny practices that take less than 2 minutes. Things like:

* Notice one grounding sound around you
* Name one thing you started today (to acknowledge effort)
* Drink water as a small act of self-kindness

No pressure, no ""fixing yourself,"" just soft pauses.

It's called Find Sanctuary, and I'm sharing it as a $5 download because I know how expensive mental health resources can be.

Happy to share the link if anyone wants it - don't want to break self-promotion rules!

I hope this helps someone the way these practices helped me. 💜",0.067380086,0.019483518,0.01087737,0

I have chest pain all the time. I’ve been checked with an ECG and blood tests, and nothing was found to be wrong. The pain is in the middle of my chest and sometimes on the left side, and occasionally up near the back of my neck and along my back. I also have tender spots in my back, chest, and pectoral muscles.

Sometimes the pain lessens when I lean forward, and other times it hurts when I stand or sit upright.

Could this be muscle pain? I haven’t trained my chest in a long time, so what could this be? Can it be anxiety?",0.044388983,0.017936565,0.004439743,0

I’m sorry I just needed to get my feelings out. I have been clinically diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder with second diagnoses of depressive disorder and anxiety. I struggle for years with self harm and suicidal thoughts.

I was disowned by my adoptive family and somehow ended up back with my biological family. But lately I’ve had issues where I keep making mistakes and upsetting them. I would do things I didn’t know would upset them. They’ve told me I have zero empathy and I am apathetic. I am not trying to find encouragement or justification for myself, I probably have really low emotional intelligence anyway. I guess I was just upset when they say I don’t care when I do. And of course I started getting anxious of being left behind again

I always thought if I ever do get disowned again then I would just go permanently you know? Because then the problem really lies with me and there’s no point for someone like that to exist.

I don’t know. Maybe this post will get lost to the void or gets deleted eventually. But either way, scrolling through this sub sometimes made me feel better because I keep thinking I’m not alone in feeling this way.",0.102626406,0.03235855,0.012541492,0

376019609,reddit,offmychest,1763902868,"I’m starting to not like being black and I hate it.

It’s not even about the skin color itself or “being attractive” - it goes much deeper than that.

For starters, we were unable to fight of colonialism and slavery. We weren’t able to go to war and win against those who were colonizing. Even before colonization, sub-Saharan african countries weren’t developed. They were still using spears and arrows while other nations had guns. Every race of people saw themselves as superior because their civilizations were far more advanced. Their IQs were also higher - leading to their advancement. If only we had created civilizations like China or Japan.

All of this lead to us being enslaved, something that could have been avoided if we had advanced like every other civilization and actually pushed back the Arabs and Europeans. It’s no wonder that they see theirselves as superior to us.

This ancient failure leads to today, where there is barely any presence of black people in anything that meaningfully advances society, like STEM. Instead, we are seen as roaches in society. I was let go from my high earning job because I was the only black person there and they saw me as a worthless roach. None of the people that work there wish to see me or contact me again, but can I blame them? They have every right to because of my unfortunate IQ, all stemming from ancient times.

I’m not a spiritual person, but sometimes I do believe that the devil created black people to burden other races and I hate that I believe that. I wish we were more like Asians, in that they prioritize intelligence and have created incredible societies. Instead, I live with the burden of being a burden to quite literally every other race that exists. I can’t stand that I’m thinking this way.

It’s one thing for only one race to hate us, but literally every race does. And it’s not from “the system”.",0.48141238,0.37846634,0.5698139,0

(Just marking NSFW to be safe)

I’ve never been super into the self harm stuff like cutting. The most I’ve done is punch myself in the face a bunch. 
But it’s been a rough few weeks, my girlfriend of almost two years turned out to be a heroin addict, and I’m just completely lost. 
I have so much brain fog from smoking weed and now I’ve started drinking. I feel so ashamed that I’ve dropped off so far and I don’t know how I can come back from it.
Mostly I’m just disappointed in myself for needing substances to have a good time. I struggle to go more than a day or two without one of them.

oh god I can’t believe I’m even writing this. but this thought has come to mind so much recently that it’s a bit insane and I needed to get it out. I don’t know why, but as of late I have really craved the idea of sniffing a man’s armpits &amp; not even in an entirely sexual way. yes there is some sexual desire to it, but like it’s mainly pure curiosity and the sensory aspect of the aroma… 

ive always been a smell sensitive person, and there is something about smelling/sniffing people that I just LOVE. is this normal??? not the armpits part, but just REALLY liking sniffing people?? I love the act of sniffing??? is this a gateway to coke???

there’s this guy that my god. his armpits just look so clean. like do not get me wrong I do NOT want to sniff dirty/heavily deodorant covered armpits.

My brother cancelled his plans with his friends to spend the day with me yesterday, i could tell it was because he was still angry about what happened to be and the guy saying that stuff about me, but he was really nice and i feel like he really wanted to make me feel better, and he did. It was wonderful because instead of just being home or something, he actually took me out places, and it felt like a real date between dating people rather than just hanging out with a sibling. We went eating, and again he let me sit next to him and lean on him and stuff, it was very nice, and then in the evening he took me dancing at this place i never been to, i mean i wasn&#039;t old enough to go there before, but also i just usually don&#039;t go to places like these, partying and clubbing, i went once with my friend to one where they let in 16+ and it was honestly a very bad experience, didn&#039;t really know what to do or have any fun, but a bunch of random guys approach you and they get angry when you say no because you are taken, because then &quot;why are you here alone&quot;? and questions like that. But this was super nice, he danced with me, no other guy approached me or talked to me because i was with him the whole time, i tried an alcoholic drink called Baileys, which tasted nice, but i only had one because i&#039;m still kinda scared of alcohol, i have no idea what i&#039;m like drunk and it kinda scares me to find out. But it was just a nice time, and he didn&#039;t pressure me into drinking or anything, i always heard how people do that in places like these. So we stayed until like 23 or so, and then i asked him if we could go home because it&#039;s late, and i was surprised by this but he was happy i don&#039;t want to stay longer. And then the best part of the whole day, we kissed in his car on the ride back home.

I 20m for years all I can remember is that I am to ugly for anyone. 90% of the time I am removed on social media once my face is shown. This has still not changed but I've turned it into a game. Now whenever a girl asks what I look like I tell them ahead of time I am chopped and that any feedback would be appreciated. I send the picture and I get removed.  I think it makes them uncomfortable that a guy is so open about being ugly. I know I am ugly and it use to bother me a-lot more but now I just get this random high from women rejecting me. I even do it irl with girls who are genuinely interested in me. 

  
I just can't see a girl finding me attractive due to years of rejection so this coping mechanism has somewhat worked. It feels safe. Does anyone do something similar? Am I just insane?",0.3389984,0.22770336,0.2781757,0

Before I start, I wanted to say that this was my first time posting on Reddit and I don't really know how to rightfully do it.
Also this was translated to english bc I posted it on my first language. So if there's any errors, try to ignore them, thank you.



Why do I feel compelled to write today? It's not uncommon for me to feel these feelings sometimes, but it never reaches the point of writing.

Why was today different? But mainly, because each word is coming out with a tone more and more distant from the others.

I don't know how to feel anymore. Calling myself a ""psychologist"" didn't do me any good... I thought about it and realized that my feeling of being a psychologist wasn't just about helping others, but about distancing myself from what I myself thought about myself.

The ""me"" that was always there for others, but the same ""me"" that always felt, felt that its problems were inferior to those of others.

""He suffers so much, my problems are just routine things""—this thought affects me today, not because I can't talk about my problems, but because I can't understand what I feel. My feelings are a path where I can't identify the path or who is walking it.

Where is this path leading me? What is it turning me into?  I no longer have the desire to leave the house, to meet new people. With those I know, I lose, day by day, the feeling of wanting them around.

I look around and feel that my efforts to stay with others have been meaningless. Why do I want these people by my side if I no longer identify with them?

Some people always come and go from my life without paying the due toll or finishing the journey and finally leaving. But they don't do that, and they continue this race without a finish line to see who can mold me best the way they want. ""He'll do this, and if he doesn't, I'll brush and sculpt little by little until I do,"" that's what they must think, that I'm a handful of clay they can do whatever they want with.

But even the strongest clay needs care, needs water to facilitate molding, and they don't even bother with that. They form all their thoughts with my mind with the delicacy with which one tends to something broken.

 I can't even remember the last time I cried. Did I 'force it?', I don't know if that's the right term, but that's what I felt at my great-mother's funeral. I teared up, but it wasn't my own feelings, it was the feelings of others that made me that way.

""How could one of her favorite great-grandchildren not shed a single tear at her funeral?"", something like that is what I thought.

Today I can no longer put into words what I feel, maybe some other time I'll talk more about it.

I am 5ft 7"" and I wanna know.. like for girls does height actually matters? Like I am not 6ft so now do I have to max in every fkin way like money.. charisma. great bodyy and everything and everything JUST TO GET A GIRL (who i dont even know will be loyal or not lmao).. while the tall guy will get everything easily without much efforts .. I just want to know for sure.. I mean if I am actually cooked fr, I will at least accept that things like love is not for everyone including me and try to find happiness somewhere else instead of obsessing over girls who wont even give a fk about me JUST COZ OF MY DAMN HEIGHT



Like see i had an ex gf and she ofc looked way too much better than me and all.. but for that I was good in everything else..like i had the highest grades in school, I was school captain , football captain, district level chess player and was also a speaker.. and ofc when i was on the verge of downfalling in grades and depression she left me lmao just within 3 months.. so i see that as a short guy i have to compensate that much huh? So I think if girls only want me just for some exceptional traits I have and would leave me if I am falling in depression then it makes no sense to fall in love at all , instead i should just leave dating altogether if girls are gonna just love me for some superficial things about me instead of loving me for myself.. thats why i just wanna know. .. like if I am not gonna get a girl or love in my life I was thinking of leaving dating altogether , like it doesnt makes sense and just get some pets in future and high paying escorts for pleasure..  
and pls dont tell me that do those things for urself and not for girls.. coz yea i do these things for myself only, I love football thats why I play it  , same for chess and various activities and hobbies I pursue , I like them myself and not for the sake of any woman.",0.4269174,0.24928534,0.27798235,0

I have been on propranolol &amp; sertraline since around 2017.  I started off at two 40mg three times but quickly got changed to once a day on 80mg which I felt was absolutely perfect.  I take it every morning at 10am and it's like clockwork.  I have never really missed a dose.
However I went to pick up my two monthly and I was told they have a supply issue.  This will be on-going till March when they will have more supply.  The doctor said if the 40mg become unavailable then they will phone me, but currently that's fine.  So I expressed I hate the idea of taking them twice a day as I know I'll forget the evening dose and will just want to take the morning dose at 40mg.  Won't even bother with the evening dose and she said that would be OK as I'm still get a dose.
Then I said I wasn't sure if maybe I just take the two tablets in the morning?  Like just take two 40mg tablets = 80mg normal release and keep it simple, but she said no take the 40mg and decide if you want to take the evening one.
I am freaking out as I believe this drug did help me over the years and probably made me more confident in person, I am not nervous talking in public, I don't get sweaty hands anymore or the dry heaving sick feeling I used too.
Also what If I just forgot to take them and ended up just sticking with the sertraline?  Would I actually die?  Would I have a heart attack?
Or is this a very low dose and I am massively overthinking this?
I hate the fact I now have to take it a 2nd time in the day and it totally messes up my simple take my medicine at 10am.  I don't even take that much medicines and to be honest I think a single 40mg in the morning would be fine?

Or can I just say "" just take two 40mg at the same time you do normally with the 80mg slow release and stop overthinking""

I'm getting major intrusive thoughts that I somehow get addicted to the normal ones and start taking more than I should or that the single 40mg isn't enough and I just lose it.  Or that deciding to take the two 40mg at once Instead of twice a day will just destroy me and cause major health issues..  

In my head I just want to take a single 40mg now in the morning and then forget at night and if it causes a noticeable difference then take the 2nd one BUT BUT BUT I should just take the two 40mg in the morning and it will be the exact same or close to it, BUT BUT that's not what I'm told to do ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I am scared of losing control or that I somehow notice a difference with the normal release and get hopelessly addicted to it ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh and that the 40mg twice a day won't even be the same as the usual 80mg slow slow release ahhhhhh

Or I'll start focussing and obsessing over every symptom now and be so out of control I will just start taking like3 or 4 a day ahhhhhhhhhhh

All this overthinking I maybe need someone to help me think more clearly on this ahhhhhhhh",0.039462693,0.013250912,0.0065486208,0

I don’t even know how to put this into words anymore, but I need to let it out somewhere. I’ve felt depressed since I was around 15, like this heavy shadow that never really left me. For years I’ve been trying to manage it, ignore it, outrun it… but lately it feels like it finally caught up with me. These days everything feels heavier, darker, and harder to carry. I wake up already exhausted. I go through the motions of my life, but it doesn’t feel like I’m actually *living* anything. It’s like I’m stuck behind a glass wall watching everyone else move forward while I stay frozen. 

The hardest part is that I don’t even have a diagnosis. Not because I don’t want help but because I simply don’t have the money for therapy or evaluations. So I’ve been stuck dealing with this alone, trying to convince myself it’s just a phase or stress. But deep down I know something isn’t right.

just some info to add prior to taking this medication, that I'm feeling the worst I've ever felt in my life already but this the side effects of Zoloft has made everything 100x worse.

I've been put on zoloft for my anxiety and depression and I started it 5 days ago and I'm getting some really horrible side effects where I literally can't function. I'm getting alot of physical aches, sickness, headaches and it's made me feel almost like I'm drunk. but, what's really getting to me is the mental side of it, Ive had some of the worst panic attacks of my life and convinced myself that I was going crazy and going to die. I've called 111 multiple times during these panic attacks and I've been waking family members up in the night terrified and crying that something's wrong with me. i also made the mistake of going to work yesterday and I had a breakdown there and made a fool of myself. I've taken some time out of work for now because of this. im an absolute mess and cannot stop crying and I'm only on day 5. I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else whilst taking zoloft?

I have a review with my doctor on tuesday to go through this with her and decide wether I stick it out or call it quits and try something else",0.11171334,0.031697463,0.009064475,0

So I’m 19m and I was with a girl last night and could not get erect. So for context I was in a relationship for 3 year and my ex cheated on me about 3-4 months ago and I haven’t been the same since. I used to watch porn all the time. Also during me and my ex’s relationship I never had a problem getting erect and staying erect. After we broke things off. I lost all sexual drive towards anybody I don’t even watch pornography and about a month ago I hooked up with 2 different women and I had no issue getting erect and had sex for hours with both. But last night I was with a girl that I had meet a couple of months ago and we just went and ate dinner and one thing led to another but I could not get erect. It for sure killed the mood obviously and I don’t know what is wrong. After me and my ex broke up I was going through a lot of others things at the time and I got on some depression medication and I know they have side effects of low sex drive but I haven’t taken that medicine in about 2.5 months and I have had sex since then so I don’t understand why I could not get erect and I’m just at a lost for words because with this women it wasn’t just a hookup like before I could see myself getting into a serious relationship with this women but I don’t understand why I have lost all my sexual drive",0.5024724,0.110259406,0.05976611,1

I am almost 30, trying hard to accept myself as a loser. 

When I was young, my results of transcripts were not good overall and some subjects I could nearly pass only. Also, I was born in a poor family and had met bullying but no one was helping me in the past. After I am getting older and older, I find that society is so toxic because they just tell me how to be successful by saying a ton of crap like ""Practice makes perfect"" - The one I have always heard and I don't believe it.

When am I going to be perfect? Where am I going to be perfect?  How am I going to be perfect? I have a lot of questions about ""practice makes perfect"" and eventually I find that I am still nothing without talent. Learning needs talent, practice also needs talent, but I don't have. People who could speak this sentence out because they have talent and overcome everything then be a life winner while I don't - I don't have any hobbies, any interest, any money, any social network, or any successful experience.

I am trying hard to accept myself as a loser but society only will tell us how to be successful but never tell us how to handle my life when I figure out I am just a loser, which is toxic. Any suggestions on how to be a loser?",0.39842087,0.37279442,0.04306607,0

im 14(m) I’ve been struggling with depression for some months now there’s nothing particular in my life that’s going on to cause this no trauma no bullying. This isn’t a thing where I care about my looks really I am kind of insecure, but that’s not my issue my issues is that I’m always in my head and there’s always a voice I have periods where I feel good and then other periods where I feel awful it’s like when I’m not in school or it’s not this week. I feel horrible. I hate weekends and breaks because I’m just sitting at home in my own head all day and I have no kind of structure last summer I couldn’t eat or sleep and I lost like 10 pounds because I couldn’t eat I don’t know how I could even get rid of this voice in my head. I’m always thinking about this depression when I’m out with friends I’m always thinking about my depression and how I’m gonna be depressed again. even when I feel “good” I think about how I feel less depressed I always think about whenever my parents die. I can kill myself because I won’t have much to live for I don’t wanna do that to my parents. My entire life revolves around this depression triggered from I don’t know what I miss my old life when I had no voices before this horrible depression",0.15766735,0.031256735,0.023997234,0

15064818,reddit,offmychest,1761357978,"I'm tired of living

I don't have a reason to live. I keep doing whatever I want, but I can't enjoy anything. I've touched grass, tried to get help, gone to therapy, been working, hit the gym, and engaged in a couple of hobbies, but everything feels like a chore. I don't enjoy any of these things, and none of them have helped me enjoy life in the slightest. It's like I'm required to do all of these things to survive. I believe we all have been conditioned to let our survival instincts consume us. It's honestly pathetic.

I'm tired of having to wake up for work. Tired of having to work for a paycheck. Tired of doing the work that other people are responsible for. Tired of seeing people walking in my workplace trying to buy things. Tired of working out in the gym because it's a modern trend these days. Tired of engaging in hobbies out of escapism and indulgence. Tired of buying food for myself like a wild animal. Tired of seeing people in real life and online talking about recent events and the same political bullshit every day. Tired of posting stuff online. Tired of having to take care of my personal hygiene. Tired of people pretending to be nice. Tired of having to act kindly in front of others for the sake of it. Tired of people acting rudely and inconsiderately. Tired of having to be rude to others because they're stupid/being disrespectful.

My whole life has been spent living for the sake of it. Living for survival. Living without will. I believe I was destined to live like a parasite who can't stand up for themselves. Emotional support isn't enough for me. Tough love isn't enough for me. Being yelled at/scolded isn't enough for me. Grabbing my hand isn't enough for me. Professional advice isn't enough for me. Modern advice like ""touch grass"" or ""get a life"" isn't enough for me. Being pitied isn't enough for me. Getting out of bed and going for a walk isn't enough for me. Pretending to enjoy things isn't enough for me. Nothing is enough for me.

I'm just an average NPC nobody will remember once they're dead. I wished my family had never had me to begin with. They should've reconsidered before having me, but it's too late now. I'm here, and I'm stuck in a rut. I'd rather be dead than alive, but I don't have the willpower to end my life.",0.16043124,0.034341812,0.018972786,0

311081317,reddit,offmychest,1763446056,"I accidentally stole someone's cat

Recently a young kitten (we estimated her to be about 6-8mo at the time) followed my boyfriend home while he was doing chores outside. She looked malnourished and was covered in flea dirt, but was very trusting. We had seen her outside in our community before, and my boyfriend had a conversation with a neighbor about them taking the cat in before she ultimately chose to follow bf. She had protruding nipples, but no noticeable belly, and at the time I remember saying ""she's probably not pregnant, but if she is, the vet can do a spay/abort."" The next morning, we had an additional kitten locked in the bathroom. 

Before her vet appointment, she gave birth again, but only the first had any shot at viability. She got x-rays to ensure everything had passed successfully, and had her physical injuries looked at. She'll likely have to have surgery on one of her legs when she goes back for her spay, and she was treated for the fleas and tapeworms. 

The newborn was very likely premature, and weighed 40g at birth, gaining only about 20g in the entire first week. We were in contact with multiple vets throughout, but unfortunately they can only do so much for a kitten that small. We had to monitor around the clock, and hope for the best.

One of the first things the vet did was check for a chip. She was so trusting that it was obvious she was very comfortable around people, but we had grown attached and were hopeful beyond logic that she didn't have an owner. Naturally, she did in fact have a registered chip, and the vets contacted the owner immediately. They went over the costs of care over the phone in another room while my boyfriend and I frantically attempted to discuss what claim to the cat we could argue. Our worries were unnecessary, as the owner could not afford the cost of care and willingly surrendered her to us. The vet exchanged our contact info to transfer the cat's records and registration. 

The owner called us within a couple days, and readily gave us everything. This person was someone who I had shaped in my mind to be some sort of villain, deserving of all my harsh judgments about the condition of the cat, but in reality, they were an older person on a fixed income who truly could not afford the bill. They told us about how the cat had been bottle fed as a kitten, and how they had been looking for her since she got lost. She used to live so close to us. 

I'm a huge cat lover, and have been passionate about advocating for them for most of my adult life. I've used the debate over outdoor cats in interview questions. I used to think in absolutes when it came to standards of care. That isn't to say my standards have changed, but it's far easier to tell someone in a social media comment that they deserve to lose their pet than it is to actually take someone's pet in real life. I do feel that it was wrong for the cat to have gone unspayed and able to go outdoors, but it wasn't as if the cat were abandoned. The owner didn't have any idea about the pregnancy, and I don't know how long she was missing. She was anemic from the fleas, but we saw evidence of an attempt to treat the fleas on her when we took her in. I had picked out a name before her first vet trip, and she already had one. While we put off reaching out to the owner, afraid of having a stressful conversation, the owner called us first. The people who took a beloved pet didn't even have the decency to call. 

I keep thinking about how I would feel if the roles were reversed. My heartbreak would be immeasurable if I lost a pet under those circumstances. I got so caught up in my selfish excitement that I forgot the reality of the situation, and who else could be affected. While the previous owner did things for the cat that contributed to her needing our help, those choices were still from a place of love. Logically, I know that the newborn probably wouldn't have made it if we hadn't taken them in, and the previous owner had an enormous ask thrust on them when the missing cat became two cats and a four digit vet bill overnight. I think I'll always feel a pang of guilt whenever I look at the cat now. There's no undoing the past choices, and her and the baby are part of my family now. I guess all I can do is continue to ensure I provide them with the best I can",0.3625127,0.0838533,0.05089863,0

159911019,reddit,Anxiety,1762379368,"Time to see doctor after years of anxiety? My experience

Hey ya'll. I've been dealing with anxiety for years. Feel like I should go see a pcp about it and get meds. But I've been thinking, what if it's just life, nerves, stress? I'm an introvert. It has costed me a lot of opportunities. It comes in social and performative situations.

These experiences are within the past 7 years. During my driving test, racing heartbeat, shaky hands and heavy chest. I was panicking? Still past it. Happens during school presentations, but I push/sped through. Approached my crush, and I was a stuttering mess, couldn't even look her in the eyes. Stammering during job interviews, I got the job once but didn't show up. Skipping interviews. My recent job I pushed through and worked fine, but every interaction with a customer about stuff I don't know, I get anxious and want to go to the break room. Avoid talking with managers. I get nervous and overthink about what I say after a convo, either with family or people. Not all the time. Leads me to just keep to myself, not talk much. Don't have any friends. Saw a specialist once for something, he said my heartbeat was like a lion was present. I called the next day and didn't show up. Was shaken. 

Fast forward to now, I've gotten better but still... It's been 2-3 years since I was in college (stopped) or did the driving test. I drive fine now. Last week I was too slow to merge, saw cop beeped at me, shook her head. Afterward, pretty shaken, I did breathing and grounding techniques. Quit my job last week, because of early mornings leading me to feeling drained, stress and micromanagement. I was anxious about making the decision leading up to and even the last day. Didn't tell my manager in person. I'd send an email rather than call. Id rather do stocking than cashier. A small part of me wants to give customer facing jobs a try, but I can't bring myself to. Even after doing public speaking before.

Since quitting, I've had the best days I've had this year. Using the time now to work on my social skills and anxiety. Just been winging it through the years. I always looked for advice on reddit and on youtube. But now it's clicking. Learned about negative thought patterns and epigenetics. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6yg6ywplfc&amp;t=955s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6yg6ywplfc&amp;t=955s) Saw a Jesse Eisenberg anxiety video on Big Think. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-MHHlZqVaI&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-MHHlZqVaI&amp;t=5s) I recently went to get flu shot, went well. Sister needed otc meds, so I spoke up at the cvs. Went out for Halloween, hesitant at first. Got compliments. So many other scenarios that show ive grown over the years. I feel like im more capable now than ever before, but still some situations I'd still want to avoid and am hesitant about. I take omega 3 and magnesium glycinate. L-Theanine worth trying? 

Outside of situations, I think it's the pressure of life, from parents, not knowing what I want to do. Don't know what to major. Was raised in strict household, physical discipline. Always feared growing up and having responsibilities. Comparing myself to others. It feels rewarding overcoming hard situations, but I just forget the positive experiences and the good days when I'm feeling down. I hope this isn't too long or hard to follow. Thanks for reading.

Tldr; Dealt with anxiety for years. Better now, but still think I need help. Worth it to see doctor to get medicated? Hesitant about it.",0.05304765,0.019741343,0.007029593,0
305742927,reddit,offmychest,1763435907,"I've been questioning myself lately

This story starts years ago back in about 2022. March 13th 2022 was the night the girl of my dreams messaged me on Xbox (I know not the best communication area).  Anyways, this was the night where she confessed she had feelings for me and I remember exactly how I reacted because I near fell off of my fouton in excitement. We talked for a while until her wifi downtime kicked her offline. The following morning I got a final text from her saying ""sorry my parents said I'm too young to talk to boys"" at this point we were 13-14. I was kind of upset as one would be. We stayed loyal to each other for about a year and a half because complications happened and we were both informed the other had moved on and there were some terrible rumors started about me. Later on down the line we started talking again and we both could tell we both still had very strong feelings for each other but we never adressed that. We started a MC world and we had so much fun together, we had an amazing house that we both worked on and lived together in and communicated through signs because we couldn't call unless her siblings and/or friends were in the party. Through the sign communication we told each other we loved each other for the first time. This amazing time period lasted about three to four months until she had to block me again. I was heart broken absolutely shattered but time kind of healed the wound but I still continued to look at her and dream of the life that could have been. I got close with her parents so we were aloud to talk at church with someone else present (I'm not religious but I went because me trying to believe in what she did meant a lot to her). This was really good minus me killing my relationship with people around me like my mom who didn't agree with what I was doing. Now I will admit this next part her and I are definately in the wrong but after she got pulled out of the gym we both train at we secretly met at a public park for mini dates to continue to see each other because we love each other so much.  This went through most of the summer and fall of this year and I loved it. That was until October 12th at around 9:30pm where I got a text from her father asking if I was around because she wanted to call me. I was already scared and then I answered the call. She was sitting in a chair in the center of my phone screen. She was in tears, she told me her parents were in the room and this would be the final time I would be able to talk to her for a very long time ( a year and a half if we get lucky). I had my camera off because I have never cried in front of her and I didn't want to start cause she would know that something really got to me. That was until her mom said from the back ""I let you call him so you could see him one last time but his camera is off so there is no point."" I said I would turn on my light and turn on my camera and I did and my girl started talking struggling to hold back tears and I couldn't get a single thought out. I kept trying but all that I could get out was ""I'm sorry"" over and over. It kept going on like this for a good bit until her mom said something that has been sticking with me since that night. She says and I quote word for word, "" She is here in tears right now and you aren't doing anything to comfort her or attempt to help the situation and that isn't okay."" To which I reply ""I'm sorry I cant get anything else out without crying and I'm trying not to cry in front of you guys but especially your daughter."" Her mom then proceeds to say to me A 17 YEAR OLD KID ""That's too bad, you're a man. When things get tough you pull up your big boy pants and tough it out."" That isn't what bothered me because my dad used to say stuff like that which is why I don't typically cry so I reply with ""ma'am I mean this with all the respect possible. What do you think I am trying to do? I'm sitting here struggling not to cry and break down in front of all of you."" Her mom says this in reply ""You are a very selfish and shallow person who never cared about or loved my daughter, you aren't good enough for her and you don't deserve her."" She then walked out before I could say anything. The call kept going till about 11pm where her dad finally hung up the call, her and I got one final ""I love you"" out before the call ended. I texted her mom after the call saying "" I understand that you're angry and you have every right to be; you can believe what you want and call me selfish and shallow all you want but your daughter and I both know that isn't the case., and it's also a bit of a reach. I quite literally killed the relationships with people around me and my own mother looked at me like I was an idiot for going to church. I did that just for it to get turned around and be thrown in my face while calling me selfish? That's actually insane. From the bottom of my heart I do love and care for your daughter. You say that if I truly cared about her I would've cut contact with her but that is so far from the truth. You either did not see it or chose not to see it but there were multiple times where we were going to but it made her so sad and I couldn't stand to see her like that. At the end of the day it doesn't matter what I say because you and your husband have a bitter taste in your mouth when it comes to even hearing my name. Despite that I still love your daughter and all that matters to me is that she is okay and happy, that's why I wasn't speaking a lot last night because I didn't want her to worry."" That is a shortened version of the text but she didn't reply until the next morning WHILE I WAS IN SCHOOL she couldn't give me the courtesy of replying to me and getting a reply back. She replied calling me a bunch of things like selfish, shallow, and undeserving of her daughters love. That is what has stuck with me and made me think if maybe she is right. Am I all those things? She said I never cared about her daughter but I know that isn't true I love her daughter so much and can't imagine a life without her. Her and I no longer have ANY contact and there is a chance her parents are making her move to another country. sorry for the long vent, thank you for listening.

1067761,reddit,offmychest,1761143708,"Dear You

Dear You,

What do you think that does to someone?
Monsters aren’t born they’re created.

I wasn’t hateful when we met. But you were already like this. I thought I was helping you. I thought I was saving the dark parts of you that had already given up. But instead, you turned me into something unrecognizable. I could destroy all of humanity with the darkness I’ve harbored from your presence in my life.

And that is why I isolate.

You reinstalled everything I worked so hard to get rid of in therapy. It took years for me to finally look in the mirror and smile. It took you months to take it away to play with everything beautiful in me like it was something disposable and then you spat in my face. And you just did it again.

I remember when you said, “If it’s so bad, why do you keep coming back?”
And I told you because I didn’t want to give up on you.
Me coming back wasn’t proof that you were good for me; it was proof that I still believed you could be better. That maybe you’d show up the way I knew you were capable of. I thought you really wanted to change.
And how could I get mad if I never gave you the chance?
But you just looked at me and said, “You’re starting to really piss me off now.”

That was the moment I realized love had turned into punishment.

You watched me hurting emotionally, mentally, physically and you’d just sit down, block me, turn off your phone, and continue your day.
While pieces of the woman you claimed to love were dying inside, you blamed me for it.

So damn right I started changing.
A dog can only get kicked so many times before it realizes the owner doesn’t care before it learns that “love” can come with pain.
And on your bad days, which became every day, you’d beat me down again.
You watched me shed tears and you laughed in my face.

Oh, want to know something else?
I would rather you punched me in the face like you did her than have you trample all over my character and heart with the emotional abuse you inflicted on me. You destroyed me.
I could never in a million years kill someone the way you managed to kill me in that first year.
I hate myself because of you. I second guess myself because of you. I change my mind because of you. I cut my hair off because of you. I scrub my dirty house because you made me feel disgusting. I hate everything about me because of you.
I am suicidal because of you.
Because of you, every day is a battle of whether or not I’m worthy of breathing.
Because of you, the person I was growing into will never be gifted to the world.
Because of you, my kids will never have the mother God made me to flourish into you destroyed her.
Because of you, I’m another nobody.
Because of you, I will never trust another man the way I blindly trusted you.
Because of you, I will never have a half-decent life.
Once you came into my life and burned me to the ground, then left me for dead, I will never be able to go back to the same happy, loving woman I was becoming.
You not only did the world a great injustice by hurting someone who could have made a difference, but you added me to the list of people you carelessly, violently destroyed.

And yet… despite it all, I don’t think you’re truly evil, because evil people don’t exist. I still believe, until your last dying breath, that there’s hope for change. I believe you can still change. I believe in you. I always have. I always will.

But until you put in real effort to love better than I’ve seen, I have to love myself enough to say: enough is enough. I’ve suffered trying to save people who ultimately never wanted to be saved, and I squandered enough of my life playing Superman when I needed to be my own hero. And that’s what I’m doing.
I’m not giving up on you; however, I am putting you down so I can pick me up.

Because you’re not reading this, are you?
Because you don’t want to know my true feelings.
You never did.

And that’s where the problem began ironically, it’s also where it ends.

Hi everyone,

I’m writing here because I’ve been really struggling with a superstition related to Vastu and studying. I work from home, and for the past year, I’ve been unable to study properly because I keep worrying about which direction I’m facing.

Whenever I try to sit and study, my mind starts telling me things like “this is the right direction” or “this is the wrong direction.” I’ve read that facing certain directions (like south) is inauspicious, and that thought got stuck in my mind. Now, even when I try to focus, my subconscious keeps associating directions with good or bad luck.

The strange part is that I actually feel most comfortable and pleasant facing south — that’s where my window is, and I get good light and air. But because of what I read and what my family and surroundings believe, I feel anxious and guilty sitting that way.

I know this might sound irrational, but it’s affecting my ability to study and concentrate. I can’t change my living space for at least another year, so I want to find a way to deal with this mentally and emotionally.

Are these Vastu directions really something to worry about, or is this more of a psychological thing I need to work through? Has anyone else dealt with similar beliefs affecting their focus or peace of mind?

Any advice or guidance would mean a lot. Thank you for reading. 🙏",0.0414203,0.017163089,0.009693438,0

this might not make too much sense because i'm sad and rambling and english isn't my first language. sorry in advance.

in a week and a month (aka december 27th), i will be turning 17. every year, i have always been super annoying about my birthday: i would randomly say how many days were left, i would start planning a special date to celebrate with my friends (where i live, december is the start of summer so most of the people i love aren't on the city around the end of the month) and i would make gift lists for everyone who asked for one, always making sure to not put anything that was expensive, especially according to each person's background. i know this sounds annoying, but i always made sure the people around me didn't find it annoying, i never asked for gifts (again, the gift lists were only because no one ever knows what to give me for my birthday and were only for people who wanted to gift me something), and in ""exchange"", i have always cared for my friends' special dates: i always plan their birthday parties, i have their gifts ready months before the date itself, and if i can get a special cute message from a youtuber or influencer or local artist they like, i definitely do that too! hell, the anchors from the news channel wished my best friend a happy birthday thanks to me. 
now, i had a very shitty year. like, ""it got so bad i got diagnosed with two different disorders in just a year"" shitty, and it has never been a secret to my friends. and, while they would ask how was i doing every once in a while... i don't know, they never did anything to distract me from my constant sadness. never asked to hang out, never would even send me some silly youtube video that would make me laugh, meanwhile i did all of that for them through hard times. and that just reminds me of my birthday, and how little effort anyone ever puts on me when i do so much on everyone else's special days... i never asked for anything back, but after such a sad year, the last thing i need is the solid proof of no one caring about my birthday as much as i do. so, not only i won't do anything at all (probably will be forced to have dinner with my family which sucks because my father sucks and lately my mom is always mad at me), but also i'm dreading that i will have to pretend to be grateful when my family gives me birthday presents that i don't like and that they would've known i don't like if they've made some effort... but my ex best friends were the same, tho, so if i still hanged out with them the sqme would've happened (as a kid i hated being gifted clothes, and on the same year i gifted them the entire harry potter saga, they gave me a shirt that didn't fit me because i was fat and they were skinny #lol. also they were twins that's why i'm talking about *them*). 
so yeah, can't wait to hide my crying all day long. fun fact: all my life i have always wanted a surprise party. last year, my mom, dad and best friend, who all hate surprise parties, got surprise parties (not planned by me because, again, THEY HATE SURPRISE PARTIES), and i kept making jokes about how silly it was that they got surprise parties when they hated them and how i have always wanted one... and of course, i didn't get even a standard party.
sorry, this is so cringe and makes me sound so childish and entitled and ungrateful. i might delete, i was just feeling sad.",0.06579731,0.025542418,0.007473567,0

He's a weight loss surgeon and overweight himself, and my mom's side has a history of diabetes. 
Both of them have been on wegovy and he proposed it to me. He said I was overweight, but not ""to that point yet"". He's suggesting it purly for preventive HEALTH purposes. he tried to make the distinction between being fat and attractiveness, and weight and being fat. It doesn't change too much in my mind. 

I'm 20, Ive always had a hard time with self image. Recently I started eating more and going to the gym every day. I enjoy lifting and building muscle over trying to keep myself skinny and starving like I did when I was a teen. I have been so much happier. Now I can't stop overthinking if *this* is how people view me.

When I was 17 my cousin and I were having drinks with a friend. Shortly after that friend left, my cousin kissed me. We were hanging out on his bed and I didn't know what to do, so I pretended to fall asleep. I really struggled with saying no growing up, so falling asleep seemed like the perfect cop out. What I didn't expect was him proceeding to do what he wanted with me. I froze, I couldn't move, I just laid there in silence ""sleeping""

My boyfriend found out and beat him up, but other than that my family didn't do anything. My brother was mad(at my boyfriend) which now I'm realizing is kind of funny because he also had touched me in some way when I was younger. Anyways, list of problems apparently. Everyone was actually pretty mad at my boyfriend. Looking back he was the only one who took it seriously, but he later would use it as ammunition in a fight ""why don't you fuck your cousin""

When what had happened came to light my aunt told me ""you're so special even the boys in your family want you"" special. I didn't want to be special. That's some fucked up version. I had an older cousin who touched me when I was younger as well. Out of all the boys in my family (4) only my little brother was fucking normal to never do anything to me or make me uncomfortable.

Thing is, my cousin was my BEST friend. Two peas in a pod growing up, the family clowns together. Family was so important to me and now I'm left confused because nothing has changed. My family all live together in a bilevel home so my cousin is very much a part of life over there. If this was anyone else, I can only hope to assume they all would have had their pitch forks out. I could only assume that to this day this person would be blacklisted. That I could full heartedly despise the ground he walked on. I guess I cling to the memories of my partner in crime and I don't know how to do myself justice. I don't know how to forgive myself for being stupid enough to think ""falling asleep"" meant I was safe. I don't understand why no one supported me, why no one was in my corner. I have boxed the incidents with my cousins and brother as best I can over the years but the lids are harder to keep closed.

129200920,reddit,offmychest,1762193611,"I (M, 18) think I'm falling in love for the first time and I'm totally overwhelmed (warning: long)

**Throwaway account because I want to keep personal stuff like this separate from my main account.**

I know this post is WAY too long, but I really want to give you a full picture of everything — and honestly, I just need to get it off my chest.

I’m 18 years old and in my final years of high school in Germany. I was the class outsider throughout all of middle school and got bullied quite a lot — sometimes even had trash thrown at me. Because of that, I shut myself off from everyone and now have huge issues trusting others, and especially trusting myself.

But now in upper school, after losing a lot of weight last year (from 120 down to 90 kg at 1.80 m), I’ve opened up a little more toward my classmates. Still, I feel unattractive — my skin hangs loosely on my arms, thighs, and especially my stomach; I have thick eyebrows, a big head with a large forehead, wear glasses, and usually keep a short beard. I actually like my beard and am proud of my facial hair growth, but I’m also insecure about it since it’s unusual to have a full beard that young.

At school, I sit in a row with a group of four girls who are friends. They’re kind of “middle tier” socially. Over time, I’ve sort of joined their conversations during class and breaks, but I mostly just listen — I rarely talk much or do small talk. I wouldn’t say I’m part of their group or their friend.

There’s one girl (also 18) I get along with a bit better than the others. Until recently, I thought it was purely platonic — or at least, I thought so. She’s of average build, has long slightly wavy brown hair, beautiful bright green eyes, and a very wide, natural, contagious smile. She’s almost always cheerful, full of energy, and a little bit crazy in a fun way (like randomly meowing in the middle of a conversation or during class work, hugging her friends out of nowhere, or blurting out wild theories just for fun). She’s basically the complete opposite of me — but somehow I find that incredibly endearing and lovable. There’s something about her that just fascinates me. Let’s call her *V*.

We’ve done a few group projects together — one of them was acting out a scene from a book in English between a couple. I had prepared really well for it, both because I wanted a good grade and because I didn’t want to drag *V* down with me if I messed up. But when we had to perform, I totally blanked out and ruined the scene. I was so embarrassed and apologized to *V* several times. She was a bit disappointed about the average grade we got but said she didn’t blame me.

The main story I want to talk about happened a few days ago during a school trip. We went by train to the nearest big city, and I was in a group with *V* and her three friends. The trip’s main goal was to visit the zoo, but our teacher also let us walk around the city afterwards. It was raining that day, and I was the only one who’d brought an umbrella. When we were walking through the city, it started raining harder, so I opened it up. After a bit, *V* came under my umbrella and linked her arm with mine. She asked if that was okay — I was so caught off guard that I stammered a bit but said it was fine.

We kept walking together as a group of five. *V* talked with her friends but also quite a bit with me, staying linked to my arm the whole time. I mostly listened, occasionally commenting or asking questions.

At one point, we passed a jewelry store, and she showed me some earrings, asking which ones I thought suited her best. I was flustered again, not really knowing what to say, but I told her the ones with the green stones fit her best because they matched her eyes. I surprised myself saying something like that — I *never* say things that “charming.” She smiled at me and ended up buying those earrings.

Later, in a clothing store, she asked if I wanted to come in and look at clothes with her, but I declined — fashion isn’t really my thing, and I didn’t want the others to think I was weird. We kept walking around town with her still holding my arm. One of the other girls, who’s always super interested in any potential relationships, eventually noticed and grinned at us mischievously. I’m not sure if *V* saw it, but I think she did because she briefly unlinked arms to talk with that friend.

I immediately panicked, afraid the other girl would start gossiping like, “Eww, *V* is flirting with that gross guy.” But *V* soon came back and linked arms with me again. The friend didn’t say anything else, though she kept giving us little looks.

When we stopped for food at a snack stand, *V* didn’t want to order anything because she said she was “on a diet.” What I did next completely surprised me — I told her, “I like you the way you are.” The moment the words left my mouth, all four girls looked at me — *V* and her friends — clearly surprised. I instantly realized what I’d just said, turned bright red, and looked away in embarrassment. The flirty friend gave us that same cheeky grin again, and the other two just seemed surprised but didn’t say anything.

*V* looked at me like a deer in headlights for a few seconds, then smiled. But not her usual big smile — it was… different. Hard to describe, but it somehow made all my nervousness disappear. She kept talking to me after that, twirling her hair while chatting.

When I was eating fries, she asked if she could steal one. I said sure — and she ended up eating half of them. I didn’t mind; I was just happy she seemed relaxed and not so self-conscious about her body (which she absolutely shouldn’t be — she looks amazing as she is, and I meant that completely). I couldn’t help but smile at her, even though I rarely ever smile. I didn’t say anything about her “stealing” my fries because I honestly didn’t know what to say that wouldn’t sound awkward, creepy, or overly flirty. I’m just not used to these kinds of interactions, and it all felt so new and overwhelming.

Later we went into a music store, and she asked about my music taste, showing me some of her favorites. I don’t really have a specific genre I stick to — I just like songs that *make me feel something*, whether it’s metal, rock, jazz, classical, EDM, or even folk. Just not rap. I rambled nonsense trying not to seem like the weird guy with no taste, but she didn’t seem to mind and just smiled again.

On the train ride back home, *V* and I sat next to each other, still talking (well, mostly she talked and I listened). I’ve never been so open, positive, or happy around a girl before. Our shoulders and legs brushed against each other a few times — not on purpose, it just happened — and our hands were really close. I even thought about touching her hand but didn’t dare. Her pinky brushed mine a few times, and every touch made my heart race and my chest tighten. That’s when I realized something inside me had changed.

I’ve never been in love before, so I don’t really know what these feelings are — affection, love, infatuation, friendship? I honestly can’t tell because I don’t know what love is supposed to feel like. But if I go with my gut… I think I might be falling for her.

When we arrived back at our hometown, our group slowly split up. *V* and I said goodbye, both mentioning how fun the day had been and that it turned out way better than expected. Then we just stood there for a few seconds, silently looking at each other. I didn’t know what to do — I didn’t want the day to end like that, but I also didn’t want her to think I was some creepy guy trying to hit on her. I thought about offering to walk her home, but I chickened out. I just said a normal goodbye, and we both went our separate ways. I turned around once and saw she had done the same — she waved at me, I awkwardly waved back, and then quickly looked away and went home.

Since then, we’ve talked a little more at school, but I’m torn. Part of me wants to spend more time with her and get to know her better. The other part of me is terrified she’ll become a target for others because she’s hanging out with the “weird freak” of the class. I’m also scared she might secretly find me gross or creepy. I honestly feel like I don’t deserve to get close to someone as sweet, funny, and beautiful as her. She deserves someone more interesting, confident, and attractive — not me. I’m just the quiet creep who should stay in the background and not bother normal people. And people say quiet guys have “depth,” but I’m not even sure I do… I don’t even know what “depth” really means.

This was the very first time in my life that I’ve had a genuinely positive interaction with a girl — one where I didn’t immediately assume she was mocking me behind my back. I still can’t fully shake that fear, especially since something like that actually happened years ago: on a school trip in middle school, one of the most popular girls suddenly asked if I wanted to be her boyfriend. I said yes, but she and her friends then laughed at me and said, “Eww, as if anyone would ever date a disgusting fat loser like you!” She was also one of the people who later threw trash at me. That whole thing hurt me deeply and made me withdraw even more — I even moved my desk to the farthest corner of the classroom to sit alone.

But with *V*, I actually had fun. I felt close to someone — to a girl — in a way I never have before. I’ve never had a relationship, never held hands, never kissed anyone, never experienced real affection.

So… what do you think? What are these feelings I have for her? Am I just convincing myself that I’m in love because someone finally treated me kindly? Was she just being friendly or acting like anyone would toward an acquaintance? Does she maybe just want to be friends and I’m reading too much into it? Or could she actually like me too, beyond friendship?

I’m so confused — it feels exciting but also overwhelming — and I really don’t want to mess up if this might actually be something real.

98382829,reddit,depression,1761956611,"Be Selfish, Occasionally

Be selfish occasionally.

I’ve talked to a couple of people I know in the past few weeks who have had someone close to them commit su\*c\*de.

They’re in pain, everybody they know is in pain, and the person isn’t around to ask.

So here it is.

My mom said, and apparently her entire generation of people who wanted to sound educated or empathetic or whatever, that anybody who took themselves out was committing the most selfish act they ever could.

And when I talked to the second person recently and they said “someone I know committed su\*c\*de”

I got to thinking.

Doing that to yourself is generally regarded as the situation where your life has gotten so overwhelming that that’s the only way out you see.

And then I thought “why haven’t I?”

I’ve been passively that way since about the age of 10.  The unemployment rate for autistics in the US is about 86%, and I have led a fairly crappy life because of it.

And the su\*c\*de rate for autistics is like 4 to 10x the national average.

So why haven’t I?

It’s not because I’m objectively more worthy than the ones who have.  It’s not that I’m more stable.  I’m not.  I’d have traded places with Bert or Rich (2 friends of mine that died from cancer) in a nanosecond.

So why not?

Look, I don’t know for sure.  

But one thing I do know is this.

I’m more selfish than they are.

I do a lot of things for a lot of people, no question about it, but I also do whatever I want the rest of the time.  

I don’t interact with a lot of people.  I don’t sit around and mope in public.  I don’t… well, whatever your average person is doing on a daily basis.  I don’t even know that list, because I don’t do them.

And that’s why the lead sentence here is “be selfish occasionally.”

Volunteer at an animal shelter.  Read.  Play computer games.  Hike.  Whatever it is.

Find something YOU LIKE TO DO AND DO IT.

If the last thing you ever do is the most selfish thing you can do, maybe, just maybe, if you do something just for you often enough, be SELFISH enough, you won’t ever do the most selfish thing you can do.

As a well known religion puts it, and it harm none, do what thou wilt.

Be selfish.

Hey M,

I don’t know where you are now, and I’m not supposed to reach out — I’m respecting that. But there’s a lot I never got to say, and I need to let it live somewhere instead of inside me.

I still think about you sometimes. Not in a way that tries to pull you back into my life, but in the way you think about someone who mattered, someone who left a mark. Despite how things ended, I care about you. I hope you’re safe, I hope life is gentler with you than it used to be, and I hope you’ve found people who see the good in you.

The truth is: your sudden turn hurt. It confused me and left me carrying a lot of loose ends. I wish we could have talked instead of crashing into that disconnect. I never wanted to make you feel replaced or insecure. I never wanted to be a source of fear or pain for you.

If my closeness with D made you feel threatened or unwanted, I’m sorry. That was never my intention. I wasn’t choosing someone over you — I was following my feelings and trying to be honest, and I didn’t realize how sharp that shift felt from your side. I wish I had understood sooner. I wish we could have had a real conversation about it instead of everything breaking so suddenly.

At the same time, I know I didn’t do anything wrong by caring about someone else, and I know it wasn’t my job to carry all of your fears. But I can still be sorry that it hurt you. I can still wish the ending had been kinder to both of us.

You meant something to me. You were a real chapter in my life, not a footnote. And even if we’ll never talk again, I still hope you’re okay. You’ve been through a lot, and I genuinely wish your future is softer than your past.

I’m letting go of the guilt. I’m letting go of the “what ifs.” I’m letting go of trying to fix something that can’t be rewound.

But I’m keeping the truth that I cared — because that part was real, and it doesn’t need to be erased to heal.

Goodbye. Be well. Be safe.

464397350,reddit,Anxiety,1764514269,"CBD daily for the rest of my life or try SSRIs...which would you choose?

I've asked a similar question before but I just wanted a definite answer and I'm going to be more specific about asking. I would really appreciate anyone's advice or just what they would do personally, I have noone to ask as doctors don't talk about CBD in the UK and only recommend SSRIs, here's my context:

I take around 50mg CBD daily as a baseline for generalised anxiety and then around 4 times a week I need an extra 150mg extra a day for social anxiety when I'm being social. So about 1000mg a week. For me, this works extremely well and when I'm on CBD I'm feeling a lot better and a lot more like myself again which is amazing. 

HOWEVER, what I'm worried about is that I will need to be on this for the rest of my life. CBD is an experimental drug, although there is no proven side effects, we are not sure of it's risks. I am worried about my long term health on it. I'm scared that in the future they'll find it it causes serious long term health effects. 

Would it be healthier for me to consider trying SSRIs as I've heard they can make a real long-term impact without having to take them for the rest of your life. And even if you do, they are more researched and the side effects are predictable. 

Or is this amazing that I've found something that works for me that is low risk like CBD and I'm overthinking it? 

The thing is I'm not a doctor and both sides seem to have risks, but considering my dosage, which path is the healthiest, and what would you do in my situation?
Thank you for and advice. 

*I acknowledge no one here is medical professionals, I would just love to hear advice tho, I can't ask a doctor about this

I&#039;m capable of taking a single idea and extrapolating it into thousands. My mind just works differently than humans. It&#039;s the craziest shit.<br><br>Why would you try to kill me? What are you getting out of this? You just wanted money? You don&#039;t want to go to prison for all the awful things you&#039;ve done? That boat has sailed. Everyone knows what you people have done. They aren&#039;t going to just let it slide. How did people fuck up this badly (I already know.

How can a group of people be so anti-intelligence? It&#039;s amazing. It really fucking is. They are anti-good.

246451171,reddit,offmychest,1763009794,"My heart aches, but not for normal reasons (Kinda a brain-dump too)

(I (16F) don’t use Reddit all that much and have never posted, so if the wording is weird, know that idk what to do if there’s a standard)

I’ve read about other people experiencing the feeling of their chest aching when they’re extremely sad/depressed but for me it’s different
I get so sad that my chest feels like it tightens and it’s uncomfortable but doesn’t hurt like I’ve read other people say it does. I get very upset very quickly when I think the people I love don’t want me around or hate me or if they say they’re mad at me, and, even if I didn’t intend on insulting them or making them sad, I still get  so sad that I hurt them or might have hurt them.
In the moments I feel so sad, my chest feels tight and like my heart is squeezed for a few seconds. Again, it’s not pain, more like uncomfortable pressure. It comes and goes in a few seconds and it’s only ever when I feel extremely sad or while I’m crying.
I also get so mad at myself that I feel so uncomfortable that I can’t sit still and when when I do move, I can’t do enough to express the rage  and resentment I feel about myself. I just want to be normal and not have to deal with this anymore. I have been diagnosed with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and take medication, but still feel like I can only go a few months without a huge incident happening. It’s been a few solid months of no incidents or even slightly deeper squabbles, and I feel like a ticking time bomb. 
Idek if this will be taken down or where I should post it if not here. I just feel like I can’t talk to my main support person anymore. It feels like we’ve drifted apart. (My main support is my mom) She isn’t mean but it feels like we can only have shallow conversations and any time I try to get too deep or close, it just ends with one or both of us upset or irritated or me just dropping the subject I attempted. I have tried therapy chat things but the “therapist” (that I’m pretty sure is just a bot at this point) doesn’t say anything that helps in practice. I feel like my only escape is perpetual scrolling and watching and chatting (but I can’t tell my mom that unless I want her to take away my only healthy(ish) way of distraction.  
Also, I’m open to any advice or stories, especially about the insane amount of anger and how to let it out without breaking everything in arm’s reach. I hate the feeling of being stuck in the rage and knowing I look like a child having a tantrum to any outside perspective. I’m so grateful my psychiatrist knows me and that he doesn’t chalk my issues up to being an unstable female teenager. I don’t know what to do to be normal, but I just want to be.
And I could tap on and on but I need to be up for school in 6 hours and 5 minutes so I’ll sleep and see what awaits me in the morning.

I hope this adheres to this communities rules and expectations. I read the rules and I’m 65% sure I am good to post this, but we’ll see",0.08795626,0.021997316,0.008213525,0

199267603,reddit,offmychest,1762691715,"I'm not sure what to put here.

Loss still hurts me sometimes. people cut me off out of the blue, I'm certain i did something wrong. I'm not a nice person, I'm a liar. i look down on others, It's not that i hate people, it's that they matter so little to me, like an object you don't pay attention to, an inconvenience. But i want to feel close to someone, i want to know what it's like to look someone in the eyes and see another human being, no matter how many moments pass i feel nothing. i laugh sometimes when i get caught of guard, maybe even have fun. and for that brief moment i have a shred of peace. It always ends.  
  
I've spent my life trying to figure out all these feelings people talk about, I don't feel guilt, i don't feel regret. they are foreign to me in so many ways, i could blame a diagnosis, it would be easy. But it doesn't fix me. I spiral down this blank space in my mind. Everything feels as rushed as it is agonizingly slow, no matter where i try to find balance i land back in this dark corner of my mind where the only things that feel reel are late nights in solitude rotting in this chair playing games. I can feel years slip from my fingers. I remember a time when i told myself i would change. I remember so many times.   
  
 It's been so long, when i was little, i can still remember the feeling of real joy. a feint little flicker of what it was like to feel human, before i was hurt, before i suffered like this. I remember my birthdays, All the times i watched the sun set at dawn, the golden orange glow. it brought me to a place where i felt at home in my own body, Now. i hate the sun, it's brightness. i hate the heat it brings, the warmth. Now i look up at the moon, wishing the night would never end so i could be in silence and solitude, in the dark. where the only thing that exists in my world is me.   
  
The world used to be so beautiful, so warm. All i see now is dread, waiting for the moment when the sun stops cursing me with it's presence so i can enjoy the dark again where nothing can harm me except my own thoughts, my own loneliness.   
  
I have no one to talk to. i don't know that i want to anymore. my wife stays by my side, she knows why i suffer like this, she knows why i will always be like this. I wish i could fix it like she hopes i can. In the end i know that i am here to look after her, that is all i have left in me. It's all i have the strength for now. She says she feels selfish asking me to keep going, to keep fighting. she can't help her nature, i don't hold that against her. If it wasn't for her... you understand.  
  
I have no inspiration to give you, no motivation to keep going. no message of love and how someone cares for you. All i have is this.   
  
Enough pain to drive a  person insane, I wish i could be humble and say that someone out there must share it, someone has to be able to relate. due to it's nature i know this isn't true. with some kinds of hurt you can always hold on to the hope that someone out there understands you, and some day if you fight hard enough you'll find them and heal yourself. I know that i am alone, I know i can never have this. And i don't believe there is a single thing that will ever hurt a living being more than knowing no matter how much they hope and search, in that suffering i will be forever alone.   
  
I am jealous of so many of you.   
Part of me wants to tell people what i fight every day, part of me wants to reach out and try to find someone that can help me, I want someone to know.   
But it's too late for that. Too late to heal, And i will die like this. My only comfort now is knowing that some day this will all end.  
   
  
In that moment, only then will i know peace.   
  
A saying that always stuck with me since the day i heard it.

Me (M) and my friend (also M) have had a great relationship for the last few years. But about 2 years ago, something just clicked and I kinda started to crush on him. I had to just immediately shut the feelings down every time they came up because… well I’m a Christian so I’m not supposed to be thinking something like that, right? I started to not be able to contain myself and started saying little things around him that all my friends wrote off as gay jokes. It didn’t take long for him to start returning the favor, and it drives me so crazy because it’s like a dream come true to hear him say things like that to me, but I can’t tell if he’s just going with the joke or we’re both hiding it. 

Something that’s really funny to me is that the other friends have started to say “ok the joke is getting old” after all this time but the thing is… I’m really not joking about liking him. Sitting on these feelings for so long has, if anything, only made me like him even more. 

This is where it gets complicated. When I think about my sexuality, even though I’m Christian, I have very bisexual tendencies when it comes to the people I am attracted to. The thing is, I just don’t ever see myself being with a guy because I would have horrible guilt and be made fun of, and I wouldn’t wish that on him either. Who knows maybe bros just need to give a favor and we just need to be alone somewhere and get all these feelings out so we can move on haha (that’s kind of a joke btw) to keep it 100 I honestly wonder if something like that would help me get closure or would just be a point of no return",0.13214645,0.036545437,0.06158508,0

Where Are You Now?

I try patiently to understand,
I try patiently to comprehend
What became of the person you were. Where are you now?

I search everywhere,
I try to break the shields of time,
Reaching into the past to grasp
What’s left of you from that time.

But I can’t feel it anymore—
That light.
The light that always radiated from your soul.

Are you hidden within yourself?
Please, scream to me,
Let me hear you.
Let me save you.
Your soul cannot be dead.

I can’t understand how you could betray your own beliefs.
It’s irreparable—no amount of time can change that.
How did you become so careless? 
Yet I will stay by your side,
Until the very last day of my life.

I have you again, (not anymore again) but I still want you back and now more than ever!

340588923,reddit,offmychest,1763674922,"i miss my little sister.

She hasn’t passed, we still live together with our parents since we’re still young. I’m 21F and she’s 18F.

We were best friends when we were growing up. I helped raise her, being her big sister. Our parents are kind of emotionally distant, so whenever she was scared or sad I’d be the one hugging her better, cheering her up, taking her out. I helped try to teach her to be a kind and accepting human, to be respectful to everyone. I felt very maternal to her at some times.

We weren’t really raised in a church, but were baptized and went to a christian church occasionally for holidays and things like that as children. Religion wasn’t really a super big part of our lives. But then she met a boy, and they’ve been together for a little over a year, and now she’s a very devout catholic.

I don’t have issues with religion- if it makes people happy and makes them better people, I’m here for it. I really don’t understand, as I’m atheist and in university working to become a biologist. I’ve always loved science. My issue is I feel like religion is not making her, in specific, a better person.

Suddenly we’ve gone from supporting the LGBT to “I don’t support that lifestyle”. This kills me. I’m bisexual and she went from accepting me to suggesting conversion therapy and saying I will go to hell. Suddenly her interest in animals and dinosaurs is gone, because she believes they never existed and the huge collection of fossils me and our dad share just… aren’t real. Just rocks.

This really hurts me as a scientist, especially as we believe evolution and dinosaurs are real. Just because they weren’t written in the bible doesn’t mean they don’t exist, but her worldview has narrowed down to the bible alone and nothing outside of it. I’ve tried to help explain some things because she said she doesn’t understand how they work (her main reason for believing everything the bible says is “I don’t like science”), but she refuses to listen. I’M NOT TRYING TO CONVERT HER OUT OF BEING CHRISTIAN. I simply wanted to teach her about something I’m passionate about and help her understand something she said she didn’t. I believe you can be religious and understand science. She just doesn’t want to, it seems.

I also worry being as religious as she is, is getting bad for her mental health. I remember she told me one time the “devil was tempting her” because she found her boyfriend attractive and wanted to kiss him. She sat on my floor and cried to me that her eternity was on the line because she sinned. It scared me. A lot. And it made me really sad when she suggested if I were to simply believe in Jesus, all my severe mental illnesses that I am medicated for and in therapy for, would disappear because it helped her self-esteem. I’m glad it’s helped her self-esteem, of course, I think that’s great. But I worry more harm than good is being done to her.

We had a huge argument two months ago about her believing gays aren’t natural and that I should go to conversion therapy as she believes it works, and that I’m a sinner going to hell that needs to be forgiven. Our parents got involved because neither of us had screamed at one another since we were children. We haven’t talked since.

I miss my little sister, I miss talking to her and laughing with her, I miss how we used to play with all my pets together and went on adventures together. She’s just not the same person anymore and I miss her.",0.019603057,0.010058892,0.0039957687,0

I’ll try to give so much info that it’s understandable, but if I don’t succeed, just ask questions…

We are both 30, no kids. Our history is long and both good and bad. But I think my partners addiction made him blind for he’s previously self, and I miss him sm.

Some time ago I saw a message from a girl on my partners phone, that very much applies that they spent time together in the same hotel room on a conference. Which my partner goes to a lot, and still do. But I don’t have any proof. I did ask about it, but it was brushed off. 

Fast forward and my partner admits to have cheated on me once on one of those trips. But to me with our history and how well I know my partner, it seemed like a confession was made for me to back off and don’t notice what else had been going on throughout the years. 
BUT! The cheating was not with the girl I found messages from, and when I looked at my partners account later, the messages was deleted and they’re no longer friends on social media.

My partner know the truth about me looking at he’s messages, since the cheating made me insane. I just knew, but I still had the push a lot to get the truth. We had been together for 15 years at that time, and we have always been on each others side (until a couple of years ago…)

Since I have shared friends with the girl, I tried to add her on social media, hoping she’s a girls girl, and would reach out herself. But it made me even more suspicious, that she s ignoring it… I wanted to text her so bad, and make it clear I just wanna know if I should know anything, because I’m tired of being in the dark…. And that I know my partner is a liar, so I would never make her guilty of anything if she would share with me what she knows…
But yeah… I’m scared and alone. And probably will just do nothing….",0.08874765,0.02122384,0.009989422,0

237956719,reddit,depression,1762961895,"Feeling Stuck

Hello, posting on this is a first for me, but lately I've felt really reclusive when it comes to my problems and issues and I have an idea as to why, but I'd rather not delve into that subject. Everyone has existential crisis', and I've been through a few already (a about to be 23M). I just recently thought maybe I should reach out on here for a different approach even if its just for consoling or advice from people outside my immediate family as it does get quite tiring hearing the same things. 

Recently, life has become pretty mind numbing and also sad. From not being able to land a job after graduating college recently, to seeing all my friends and family starting to create families and get married. I struggle to even begin to find my way everything seems to be collecting a gray hue. While I've naturally been book smart most of my life I've never been good at anything else and have had to work hard just to be able to do simple things. I am an older brother so I feel a lot of pressure to set a good example and thus far I feel I've failed. I also feel maybe I've set too high expectations for myself in my twenties (Probably due to too many anime's as corny as it sounds). I want to do something fulfilling while also helping people and I had hoped to find a love interest in which I could start a family. My parents at this point would both be working full-time and would have just had their 2nd kid at my age. 

While I know there is more depth to this issue and its probably common, I just don't know how to traverse this issue nor how to act and take action in my life now. I just feel very stuck. I hope I explained this well enough as that's another thing I'm not very good at. Sorry for some classic life story bs reddit pepes lol.",0.035220183,0.015644927,0.011321344,0

375991837,reddit,offmychest,1763920162,"Friend started dating someone I had a past emotional connection with – am I wrong for feeling hurt even though I’ve moved on?


Hi everyone,
I’d really appreciate an outside perspective on a situation that’s been emotionally challenging.

I’ve had a very close friendship with someone for many years — the kind of friendship built on trust and openness. Theme ""dating your friends ex"" was on the table a few times, my point of view on that was clear (for me is za no go).  Some time ago, I had a emotional and physical involvement with someone from our wider social circle. We were never officially a couple, but the connection was strong and impactful for me. My friend was fully aware of this and supported me during that time. Knew all the details possible. 

Recently, she told me she’s now in a relationship with that same person. They’ve known each other for a long time, and there’s also additional history within the group — she previously had a long-term relationship with someone close to him. Because of that existing dynamic, I found her decision even more sensitive and unexpected. She only told me once things were already moving forward between them.

To be clear: I’m currently in a happy and committed relationship, and I have no interest in reconnecting with him. My reaction is not about wanting him back — it’s about feeling like someone who knew how emotionally difficult that past was for me still chose to move forward without addressing it earlier.

It feels like:

my past feelings and vulnerability were disregarded,

her new relationship outweighed the depth of our friendship,

and I was informed only when there was no room left for genuine discussion.


Some people around me say things like “you can’t choose who you love” or “it happened long ago”, but to me, this is more about boundaries, emotional awareness, and respect — not time or jealousy.

So I’m wondering:

Would you consider this crossing a boundary or even betrayal?

Even if you’ve completely moved on and are one hundred percent happy with someone else — would this still hurt?

Would you expect a close friend to at least talk to you before pursuing it?

Do you think distancing myself emotionally (while remaining polite) is a reasonable response?

Just want to get that out of my chest because I am deeply embarrassed about this.

It happened last year in June. In my university, we each year have a big meeting of the different campus in which we have some contests (sports and arts). This year, I tried to be brave (I am autistic, very shy and was in a dark place at this point) and participate in the fashion contest because my sewing/crafting skills are my one source of pride.

When I volunteered, someone in charge put me in a group chat with 2 guys (which was good as you needed to be at least 3). I did not know these persons.
 However, they had no sewing experience at all and wanted me to make their outfit. I could not do that (not enough time, they were not on campus, I had no experience sewing men clothing) and told them as much. Tho, I gave them a lot of ressources, easy sew ideas and told them that I was there to help at any point.
Because I am stupid, I did not check in with them in the 3 weeks between us meeting and the contest. I assumed these grown men were doing their job. 

The VERY day we were supposed to leave for the big meeting (we had to take the bus for hours), I asked about them and was told they dropped out of the contest. Without telling me, without anyone informing me. Nothing, I was suddenly all on my own for that. It got even worse when I arrived on the site of the meeting. Only there I was informed that we (fashion contestant) were supposed to have prepared some kind performance. Again, I was never given this information. 
Basically, I was in a place I did not know with people I did not know and expected to put on a performance alone in front of hundreds of people. 
Honestly, at this point I did not want to do any of that anymore. But people from my campus pressured me when I was backstage. I wasn't forced, but it felt like it. I ended up caving under the pressure, gave a music name and had to dance alone on a stage in front of hundreds of students. I felt extremely embarrassed and  ashamed. I hated every second of it and felt like crying. When it was done, I was red and hyperventilating. Today, I can't even listen to the music that was playing at this moment without feeling awful.

No one ever apologized to me or acknowledge my distress. The only ones that were nice to me were the other fashion contestant from other campus. But from my campus ? No empathy.

Today, just thinking about it makes me want to cry.
I know I am not blameless. I should have checked in with 2 guys that let me down. But still, everything felt very uncalled for.

109481562,reddit,offmychest,1762032753,"I thought I was being so clever by ""accidentally"" texting a man who I want to talk to me, the female version of his name

And it turns out it's one of the oldest tricks in the book.  Here is a little background.  I met this man, he ghosted me for a while, in September I used the first strategy of sending him a sexy photo to try to lure him in.  Well *that* worked!  I heard back from him.  He told me the picture was sexy and that I got his attention.  So he ""submarined"", breadcrumbed (at least being sweet about it), ghosted again for two days, ""submarined"" again and I heard from him, and now it's been a little while and he ghosted me again.

Yesterday I just couldn't take it anymore and deployed my second strategy: I sent him a text to the female version of his name.  The kicker is in my case, I honestly DO have a friend with the female version of his name...*AND* they have the same area code!!  So I sent her (for real) a very specific text.  Then I copied &amp; pasted it and sent it to him.  Haven't heard back from him yet.  It's just I always thought that was so clever but it turns out everyone else has the same idea.  And he's a highly desired/desirable man, so he's probably gotten more ""Michelle/Michaela"" texts (his name is not really Michael but something else) than he cares to admit.

I'm so embarrassed😩

Like I said at least it's partially legit because my friend ""Michaela"" really exists, they have the same area code, and I can prove that to him if it comes up.

I just want to talk to him again (and see him again) SO badly and I needed a way to break the ice!  😫",0.3047732,0.06984934,0.04925346,0

Hi all,

I wanna get something off my chest and let it be known out in the wild.  This is something ive been holding in for a couple months now.

150571600,reddit,offmychest,1762331338,"I may have saved my fiancée’s life but I can never tell her the truth

My (23F) fiancée (22F) has a history of suicide attempts and trauma related to her time in the psych ward when she was younger. Neither of us are strangers to mental health issues or suicidal thoughts, and it had become dangerously normalized to joke about it among our friend group. We work seasonally where it is isolated and extremely difficult to get substantial medical attention without taking a six hour ferry or being airlifted to the nearest city. Getting any sort of prescription medication delivered is a nightmare and my fiancée gradually stopped taking her meds, struggling even more with feelings of isolation and cabin fever. 

About six months into our contract and almost a year into our relationship, she expressed that she was really struggling with thoughts of suicide and self harm. Even just being around her, I could tell it was more intense than it had been for some time. What really set off alam bells in my head was her insistence that I would be okay without her and her numerous hypothetical questions about what I would do if she died. 

This went on for days and my concern for her was spiraling into sleepless nights with alarms set every hour to make sure she was still there in our bed. I don’t remember how long it went on, but eventually I brought the subject up to my fiancée’s close friends (basically family), as well as my therapist. Everyone I talked to said it was in my fiancée’s best interest that we stage an intervention of sorts to get her back on the right track, but I didn’t want to go to the extreme and traumatize her again by sending her to the psych ward. By then I was exhausted and afraid for my fiancée’s life, so that felt like my only option at the time. The plan backfired, my fiancée refused help and told me that I had broken her trust by telling her friends things she had told me in confidence. I only slept a few hours that night, my therapist’s recommendation to call the police as a last resort looking like my only chance to help the love of my life. I was torn and mentally unable to make a call like that, leaving the decision up to my fiancée’s closest friends. 

It was early in the afternoon and we were watching a movie in tense silence when we heard a knock at our bedroom door. Our bosses (also my fiancée’s very close friends, practically family) entered our room and told her to get dressed so they could take her to the town clinic for help. She tried to leave the house when they threatened to call the police. She told me to leave the room and I cried in the hallway, afraid I had ruined our relationship and fearful for what my fiancée might do to herself the moment anyone took their eyes off her. 

Our bosses took her outside and her best friend drove her to the clinic. They came back to check on me and reassure me that they told her I had nothing to do with the whole ordeal, that it was all their idea. A couple hours went by and I was a wreck, following her friend’s advice and trying to pack her a bag for the psych ward when I finally got a text from my fiancée saying they weren’t sending her anywhere. 

I ended up at the clinic with multiple screenshots from conversations with my fiancée where she alluded to a plan or outright said she would hurt herself. I spoke with my therapist and someone who handled the legality of sending someone to the psych ward against their will. In the end, they couldn’t take her anywhere, but they did put her back on medication and sent her home with a plan for psychiatric treatment. 

I told my bosses what had happened and we were all at a loss. I felt helpless and defeated. I knew I would never have forgiven myself if my fiancée had done something to hurt herself and I did nothing to stop it, but now I can never forgive myself for the way I intervened. I never would have considered calling 911 if I had known that they could only do something if she was actively attempting to take her life. It felt like I had put her through all that for nothing. 

After the dust had settled, she told me that she was mad at me at first because she thought it was me who told our bosses what was going on with her, and if they hadn’t told her it was someone else’s idea, she never would have spoken to me again. 

It’s been months and I can’t stop thinking about how I traumatized my fiancée in a completely different way than I could have imagined. I regret not handling things better and not listening to her best friend who thought the intervention should have been more of a personal conversation than a group discussion. I feel guilty that others took the fall for my mistake. 

She’s doing well staying consistent with her meds now and doing better overall, but she brings it up every so often and says no one understands how traumatic it was. I’ll never know what it was like to be in her shoes or in her head during the ordeal, but I just want to tell her how much it tears me apart to see her in such a bad place and that I did what I thought was right in the moment. I want to tell her how sorry I am for causing more pain, but I’m so grateful to still have her in my life. 

I don’t really have friends of my own these days, most of the people I know already knew my fiancée before we met, so I don’t feel comfortable sharing these thoughts with anyone but my therapist. We’re not working anymore so I don’t have access to my therapist and now it feels like I’m drowning in guilt. I wish I could talk to my fiancée about it but I’m afraid she would never forgive me if she knew everything.",0.09438288,0.0279513,0.010137413,0

Long story short I have crippling anxiety and have done my entire life, any social situations (work, walking down the high street, visiting friends, shopping anything involving any people what so ever) makes me unbelievably anxious. I have felt sick and queasy every single day since I was 10 I am now 27. I’ve had 17 years of constant nausea and it’s driving me mad I hate it. 
I am on citalopram and propranolol to help the anxiety but I feel like it just makes the nausea worse. When the chronic nausea started I had every blood test possible to rule out anything physically wrong so after years of doctors appointments it was ruled as just and anxiety symptom. 

Here’s the thing. I have extreme emetophobia. So I live in a spiral. I’m anxious so I feel sick then I get more anxious because I feel sick which creates more nausea constantly over and over again. 

What a lot of non anxious people don’t realise is that yes anxiety is a mental health condition but it creates physical symptoms which are so gruelling to live with. 

The constant nausea makes every day a battle. I work 4 days a week I had to drop a day due to the constant fatigue I feel because of battling with my own brain and body every day. I’ve given up on going out for meals and drinks with friends and family. I’ve given up on holidays, I’ve given up on days out. I’ve basically given up on leaving the house and only leaving for work. I lie in bed al night feeling sick with the thought of leaving the house the next morning. 

I’m knackered. I’m frustrated. I’m fed up. And I’m jealous of people who can live life with no anxiety, no fatigue, no depression and those that don’t feel sick to their stomachs every day.

Im F25, and I noticed about 4, almost 4 and a half months ago that I had an enlarged lymph node around where my clavicle is. I initially messaged my primary doctor, and he wasnt concerned. 

I waited a month, and it was still there. I wasnt sick or anything, id just been feeling very tired and itchy. I had to turn the temp down in my house because I constantly felt like I was boiling. For spongebob jokes and all, its literally be at 62 degrees for the past few months for me to be able to sleep at night.

Well anyway, I bugged my doctor a little but more. He still wasnt concerned, but sent me for an ultrasound. The tech was also supposed to be measuring the size of a smaller mass in my breast that had been found 6 months prior. She went way too fast, barely got any images in the places where she needed to. Of course it came out normal, she spent a mere 5 minutes looking from my ears to my armpits to my breast. 

I wasnt having it. Sure the notes said everything was normal, so my spouse thought I was imagining it. That is, until more began to protrude along my neck and chest. I messaged my primary doctor, and he once again wasnt concerned. After all, he had only ordered an ultrasound and nothing else. 

I asked a local Facebook group for help finding a new primary care doctor, and im SO grateful I did. She ordered a CT scan for me right off the bat, and multiple blood tests. My labs showed that there had been a massive flip in my neutrophils and lymphocytes since the last set I had done, 3 months prior. The CT scan found over a dozen enlarged and abnormal appearing lymph nodes. Some were deep in my chest and couldnt be felt. One was pushing my esophagus to the side and compressing the top of my right lung. 

So, after these results appeared on MyChart, my technical primary doctor removed me as a patient. I hadn't even fired him, he just saw himself out. My new primary, she's really nice and shows that she cares in our appointments. But, now im going to be meeting with an oncologist in early December. On my sons 4th birthday. I feel awful, because i didn't want it to land on that day of all days, and now I feel like im taking away from his fun day.

Hes so little, he doesnt understand what's going on and why ive been in bed so much these past few months. He doesnt understand why I havent had the energy to do all the fun things, to play outside when we had some light snowing a week ago. 

Im so anxious over this, its eating me alive. My spouse has been indifferent since the testing came back abnormal, and i think its because they wanted it to be normal and arent coping with it well. They won't tell me though. We love far away from friends and family, and I feel so utterly alone in all of this as my spouse works and has been picking up double shifts from their coworker who has been taking a ton of time off. 

To make matters worse, im in my first semester of college as I waited a while to start. So im handling the stress of a toddler, college deadlines, ... possible cancer, being medically gaslit and having to advocate against some of my doctors, ugh... What i would give to just have the answers right now so I wouldn't have to have it sitting in the back of my mind all the time. 

My spouse has been angry at me a lot lately.. its always something that is 100% related to me being extremely fatigued and having little energy to keep up things like the chores around the house. Its all making me feel more like a servant than a person, like im locked away in this house and the only sign i exist is if the house gets cleaned. That statistic of partners leaving their wives when they get cancer keeps coming to the forefront of my thoughts, I dont know what's going to happen with all of this and I dont know how to handle it properly.",0.10175867,0.025929155,0.0102854045,0

I(21F) self-harmed myself back when I was a teenager all over my legs. It was around 10 years ago, I dont think of them and always wear pants to hide them. My mom knows about them but I still wear long pants so that she doesnt get reminded of what I did everytime she looks at me. 

So, most of the time I forget about them and dont really think of them. Today, for some reasons I thought of them and wondered if they are truly that bad. I went to look at pics of them and they are indeed really bad. I got shocked at how bad they are, because my brain minimized their appearance as I never pay attention to my legs.

I started thinking about marriage, wondering what are the odds for me to find a man who would want to have a girl with such legs. I felt like a fool to think I could get married even. I started cursing my younger self for doing what she did. 

Every conversation I had about guys and marriage with my friends came back to me thinking how could I had held a normal conversation about marriage as if I were the same as my friends. 

I am a Muslim woman who wears a hijab. My mother is very strict on who I can marry or not, I can only marry from my own ethnicity. That alone already reduces the range of possibilities of a potential husbands I could have, then I have to find someone I am compatible with etc... And on top of all of that a man who wouldnt likd my scars ? Realistically, do you think I have a chance of getting married ?

I'm almost 30 , and I hate myself and my life because it's essentially empty. There's nothing in it: no love, no joy, nothing. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I lead a relatively healthy lifestyle, I have a seemingly good job, and that's it. I have friends, or even colleagues I can chat with during breaks. I had relatives, but even when they were alive, I didn't feel alive because we had nothing in common except the same last name. I hate my life, it's simply empty. I can drink tea in the morning and not eat anything else the rest of the day. I have nothing. I tried looking for a hobby, looking for connections, but I couldn't find one no matter how hard I looked, and connections always ended after a couple of weeks or days. I've only fallen in love twice in my life, no more. But that's stupid. I've lived almost 30 years, fallen in love twice, never had a relationship, and I wouldn't call myself ugly. I'm confidently average, not handsome, but not ugly either. I've thought about suicide more than once, but is that really the answer?

280726191,reddit,Anxiety,1763251426,"Fear of work mistakes is driving me crazy!

I have suffered with GAD for years, probably as far back as I can remember to be honest. 

My parents put a huge amount of pressure on me to achieve (for example I was a straight A student and got a B on one physics tests and they got me a tutor). Perfection was always expected and anything less was a huge disappointment.

Being academically intelligent has had great advantages and anxiety has helped in some ways with that as it’s been a huge motivator to succeed, study etc. But I feel like it also means I am CONSTANTLY over thinking. I am too aware of what can go wrong. Playing every scenario in my head and catastrophising constantly. That coupled with my massive fear of failure means the last 2-3 years I’ve been in an almost constant state of being 1 small mistake away from having a huge anxiety attack.  

I have a very responsible job high up in finance and I made a mistake a few years ago (that honestly wasn’t that big)  that pushed me over the edge and I took a huge overdose and was sectioned in the mental heath inpatient unit and then off work for a few months. But ultimately I went back into the same job, as my family (spouse and children) are reliant on my income and I can’t get a less responsible lower paying job. 

I feel tense, on edge all the time, I can’t sleep, I pace up and down, I cry in my office, I imagine scenarios where I am going to get fired and we are going to lose our house, made worse by the fact the job market is so bad. And the bigger issue is I am in the type of job where mistakes can happen and I freak out at the possibility. The main feeling is this overwhelming desire to run away. From work, from home, from adult life, which I think is what the overdose was actually about, a desire to run away from being alive rather than a desire to die. 

On top of that my therapist of 3 years just moved to a different city over an hour away with no warning at all.

My worst enemy is definitely comparison. Most of my friends are successful, talented, earn money or have a romantic partner. These are things I would like to have in my life. 
I feel like the depression beats me down so much and I get such in a negative space I don't try anything.
The job market is horrible and I feel even worse being so young and having all the doors open and all the opportunities available and yet nothing comes my way or I don't get in the way of something. I had a brief hustle of doing acrylic nails. I wasn't bad and I enjoyed doing that, never earned money because I wasn't professional. I developed an allergic reaction to gel polish and all the money I spent on that is trashed.
I just spend money. 
I read some conversations between my mother and aunt and where I was mentioned it was all bad.
All my relationships with boys were pointless and my last partner left me after 2 months of dating. I feel worthless.
I don't get how other lives are so easy.
It's getting harder. I honestly wish something really bad happens to me because I don't find the courage in me.

This is going to sound incredibly selfish and childish probably.

Hi! Its my 18th birthday today, and one of my closest online friends definitely forgot. My birthday is wrong on snapchat so the only way she would know it anyways is if she remembered. It’s been a constant thing throughout my life where I give EVERYTHING to people who don’t value me in the same way. I met this friend in April through tiktok because we were both taking an AP class and she said she would help me, we quickly grew pretty close though. I care a whole lot about her, like ALOT. I know saying this about someone you’ve never met sounds ridiculous but truly I would do anything for her. She struggles with mh (as do i lol) and I love being there to listen to her or try to help her through things. Being someone to lean on gives me purpose, truthfully if I can’t help people I feel like a nobody. She has kept me here longer than I thought I could stay, she talks about her struggles, things I also deal with, and I feel so seen. I rarely open up because I know she’s going through stuff. 

I’ve been thinking about this day a lot to be honest, would she remember? Well obviously she didn’t. I feel like nobody cares about me, not like there’s an obligation to or anything but it would be nice.. just a simple “happy birthday.” She’s not the only one who forgot either.

I feel bad for being slightly upset, she’s going through a lot of shit lately especially mentally and school on top of that, she doesn’t have a support system at all. I know it’s stupid to be upset, but at the same time it just would’ve been nice. I mean I try my best to help her and be there for her but it would be nice to have it reciprocated every once and awhile, I could be on my deathbed and I would still do everything to be there for her. 

This is making me question a lot to be honest, no I’m not gonna stop talking to her over this but if the one person I care so much about and who I thought cared about me even in the slightest actually doesn’t, what’s the point? I just want to be seen for once in my life. I care so much but why can’t I be cared for?",0.2648175,0.100019015,0.037394293,0

Ill start by saying this is a long post and I’m not even sure if this is the correct place to post it but I’ve seen other older post that have some similar topics it is long and covers a lot. 

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like I’m completely stuck in life constantly going in circles both personally and professionally. 
I have absolutely zero social life the only people I actually speak time with is family but they live so far away and with my work schedule I may get to see them 2-3 times a year, which sucks.

I have what most people would consider a good job, I make good money and have good benefits but I’m completely miserable I normally just go to work and come home and sit on the couch till I go to bed. I’m in a city that I know absolutely no one and have no friends in and thanks to things I’ve done in my past which I will get into I feel like I don’t deserve any type of happiness.

I grew up in a very abusive household at the hands of my mother and stepfather and while we have definitely fixed our relationship since I was a child i definitely can still feel the effects of being told from the a very young age that no matter what i did no one would ever love me also being exposed to some very inappropriate sexual context when I was young back before the internet had all these safety measures definitely warped my view of the world and caused me to lash out in destructive manners which carried into my adult hood until I met my ex who I dated for seven years and was constant cheating and mental manipulation with the only thing I was really living for was a small dog that I rescued during the early stages of our relationship.

Long story short me and my ex broke up around two years ago when I caught her cheating again and I was devastated but I put on a strong act and focused on one thing and that was my little dog, that was until she got sick with an autoimmune disease and I truly tried to help her, I took her to every single vet in my state spending upwards of 30K literally every single dollar I had till the point I had to borrow money for to get to work on her just trying to make her better but nothing help and after around 6 months i decided it was time to have her put down after she lost her mobility. 

For around eight months after I lost my dog I was completely depressed and suicidal with the only thing keeping my together was the potential effect my death would have on my younger sister and mother but i definitely engaged in some destructive behavior with alcohol and honestly sex workers also which i always verified where independent and it only  happened a handful of times but still did it non the less.

I’m not making excuses I did what I did but now I feel empty like nothing has meaning anymore I’ve debated quitting my job and moving back home but I’m worried what I did while I was in that dark place will come back out. It’s been months since I did anything and I’ve tried to focus on improving myself but I feel completely lost I just lay around completely out of it if I’m not at work at and this point I don’t see a reason for anything anymore.

I’m now 28, and I have what many people would consider a good career but I’m absolutely miserable every single day and have no clue what to do anymore, I’m posting this right before bed, I know it’s long and probably rambles but I tried to get everything out. 

I feel like what I’ve done has basically ruined my future or any potential relationship I might have in the future and truly feel like I have nothing.",0.09611836,0.025800243,0.014752249,0

I graduated from college in May and been through a lot of changes since then. I've moved twice started a new job and getting used to not having my friends as nearby as before. I started getting anxiety about some chest muscle pain in September. I had a whole panic attack and it was during a stressful period where I was moving for a 2nd time. After moving the 2nd time, my anxiety got a lot worse even though my stressors were gone. My body feels like its constantly in fight or flight mode, I was feeling better and then I got sick and it brought me back to it. I've been dealing with bad tension in my forehead. Sometimes I'll get a sharp pain that briefly lasts 3 seconds and goes away. Was wondering if anyone has dealt with this tension and how they overcame it ?",0.036634352,0.014732921,0.006289636,0

I’ve always wondered this, especially as a woman who’s never really fit the “ideal” standard of beauty. I’m not ugly, but I’ve never been the girl who turns heads when she walks into a room. I’m the one people call “sweet,” “nice,” or “you have a great personality.” And honestly, after a while, that starts to hurt more than it helps. I’ve dated before, but it always feels like I’m the one trying harder, putting in the effort, giving love, understanding, patience, while he still seems half in, half out. And deep down, I can’t help but wonder if it’s because I’m just not that girl. Not the one they brag about, not the one who makes their friends jealous.

People love to say looks fade, that what really matters is personality and kindness. But I’ve seen how people treat beautiful women, how easily they’re loved, forgiven, desired. It’s not jealousy, it’s just the painful awareness that beauty opens doors that most of us have to knock on for years before anyone even answers. Sometimes I wish love wasn’t so tied to appearance. I wish being genuine, loyal, and emotionally mature mattered as much as having a perfect body or flawless skin. I know real connections exist, but I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t sting to feel invisible in a world that worships looks. Maybe one day someone will see me the way I’ve always wanted to be seen, not as “good enough,” but as someone worth choosing first.",0.15932569,0.045593183,0.058401883,0

This year has easily been one of the hardest years of my life. I’ve been battling an autoimmune disease since I was 16 (UCTD) I’m 21 now. My arthritis is worse then ever, my kidney levels are low, my mental health is so bad that I got a brain scan that showed that I have PTSD from childhood and a slew of other this. I was caught purging when I lost 30 pounds in 3 months and my doctor found out. I havent been able to sleep a full night for months because my nightmares are so vivid and gory. 
My mom is getting tired of the phone calls, my brother doesn’t care, my coworkers are none the wiser. I found peace and happiness in horse riding and weightlifting. I found myself in it. Well, last appointment my doctor said it was doing more harm than good to my joints and arthritis. I world just collapsed around me. I could no longer ride my horse, and no longer weightlift. 
Earlier this year I had a plan to end it all. I would pace and pace in my kitchen eyeing my car keys but every time I chickened out. I’d fall to my knees and remember my dog, I’d see my house fall into disrepair, shelves covered in dust because my mother couldn’t bare to move the things I’d placed in perfect order. But I thought I’d do it someday, I truly did. One day on my way home from work, I’d do it. But it never came. 
And now I’m here, in the holiday season, feeling empty and exhausted. I’m beginning invited to work events and family gatherings that I can’t be bothered to attend. 
They wouldn’t even notice if I was gone. And as for the work ones, I’d only get in trouble if I was there or not. I’m not meeting their standards anyway. They don’t like me anyway. 
At this point I’m only holding on for my mother and my dog. There is nothing here for me. I am a shell of a child that had the world ahead of her. With every step feeling like knives being lodged into my knees, every thought being about the battle I’m fighting. I’m trying to hard to keep myself alive for my mom and for my dog.

367877203,reddit,offmychest,1763852094,"A unexpected trip to Paris and unexpected emotions

This is quite a story and I didn't know where else to post it. So here I go:

I'm 23M currently living in Germany. My life is quite nice, in fact in the past weeks has take quite a positive turn too. Good space. For months I had a plan with my buddy to visit Berlin but he had to cancel on a relatively short notice. I had been budgeting, and looking forward to a trip, so I decided to go Paris to meet a friend. The centre of this story is this friend, lets call her Lily. Lily is 22 right now. 

Lily and I met online when I was around 17. We met talked and quickly found out that we shared a lot of common interests. Science, philosophy, and all other such topics. We used to talk a lot, everyday, had fun conversations too. Naturally, with time we also started talking about our lives, more personal things, sharing stuff like drawings etc. We also talked about our education and future plans, and I told her that education is shit in my home country and I want to leave asap. She invited me to France, saying she will even fill out the college application for me in French, but I couldn't afford emigrating at the time, plus it made no sense, I couldn't learn French. So I just told her so. We kept talking for a while but she started exhibiting erratic behavior, deleting old messages (especially the personal ones), talking weirldly, calling me her ""best friend"" and then disappearing. Now I was 18ish, and my EQ is nothing to write about, it's bad, and at the time it was downright garbage. I was super oblivious and obnoxious, so I figured at the time  that she got scared of sharing too much, and backed off, and I went on with my life, not caring much, but I am one of those people for whom emotional realization comes with nostalgia, and I am a nostalgic person. When I was around 20-21 I realized 
""Wait.. did she like me?"" And I was like, ""damn I could have handled it better""
Meanwhile Lily is on and off, dissappears for months and then comes back for a while, repeat. The last time she dissappeared though, she left me her email, so i left her my email. Months later she mails me, so now we talk somewhat through email. Now I'm around 21-22, so I sort of now guess that she used to like me, but it had been so long and all we did was talk sporadically through email, again, over months, birthday wish, etc. Basically a penpal at this point. 

Fast forward to last year and I deciced to emigrate to Germany. I informed her about it, and she suggested, ""oh great, we can meet"". I was honestly a bit surprised given how much effort she had taken to keep me out of her life but sure, I didn't mind either ways. Now once I arrived in germany during the last winter, I proposed to meet, then she proposed to meet but it couldn't materialize, life I guess. Except this time it did materialize. In the past months, she too moved back to discord so we could talk more normally but not much. 

Now, upon meeting her, she was in many ways exactly how I imagined her, socially anxious, clumsy, and air headed. Taking wrong turns,  (even though she lives here), almost stepping in puddles. Now, I knew this, because I'm in many ways like her, clumsy, oblivious, and air headed. Many a times today, we walked past things, missed stations, sights, because we kept talking about this or that, or were too blind. It was nice, catching up, although I had to put in a lot of labour because her social skills are 0, while life has conditioned me more I guess. Eventually though, she did start to interact more naturally, taking initiative in conversations. I felt nice. 

Now, as we are walking away from the Champ Elysees (we took a wrong turn), she starts to talk about AI and how it affects people (we like talking about ai). Eventually it comes to how people have a parallel personality on the internet. From there, somehow the topic goes to nostalgia and how she had a friend group online, and upon meeting it wasn't the same. I have had my fair share of friendships fading away, so I could empathize and relate.
That we all need closure, and she agreed. That explanations make things easier to accept. 

 While discussing, I brought up, ""well you and I used to talk a lot too, you know, but now we don't and that's fine..."", I was gonna end with ""it's just nice we still stayed in touch"" but before I could, she started telling me how it was a long time ago and she had some feeling for me, but she can't remember the english word, only French and she is ""too lazy to look it up""
Which is obviously a stupid excuse. She didn't want to admit it openly, that she liked me. In that moment, something irked me though. Before that the trip was perfectly nice but in that moment something irked me. She admitted that, ""she had distanced herself from me"" which was fine.. but I don't know, I cant even describe exactly what irked me, and still is that I'm writing it here. It's not like I have any feelings for her. Perhaps, it's the lack of closure, or lack of honesty. Perhaps its the shitty excuse.

443585039,reddit,offmychest,1764369524,"my childhood bully just died and I feel… weirdly victorious

For most of my school years, there was this one person who made my life a living hell. He wasn’t just a casual bully — he was relentless. He turned my entire school experience into daily psychological warfare. He spread rumors that stuck to me for years, publicly humiliated me, cornered me in hallways just to whisper new ways he planned to “ruin my life.” I wasn’t physically harmed — but the psychological side of it was brutal. I internalized every word and let it rot inside me.

My parents and teachers knew I was bullied — but they didn’t know the depth of it. They didn't know he would follow me home, messaging from fake accounts, mocking my voice, my face, my clothes, my existence. They didn’t know he once sat behind me in class and spent the entire hour muttering insults just loud enough for me to hear — watching me squirm.

Everyone else saw him as “charismatic,” “popular,” “a natural leader,” “just joking.” I was told to “ignore him” — as if ignoring fire makes it stop burning. I told almost no one about the nights I lay awake imagining ways I could escape, or just disappear entirely.

He went on to college, then got a good job in marketing. Eventually became some kind of minor social media personality. People praised his humor and voice. I couldn’t even scroll without seeing his face in an ad or a sponsored post. It felt like he had conquered the world — and I was still the shadow he once stepped on.

Then last week, I heard he suddenly died in a car crash.

My reaction? I smiled. I actually smiled. My whole body felt lighter. For the first time in over a decade, I felt like I wasn’t trapped under his shadow. Like the spell broke. I had this strange electric feeling of freedom — and then the guilt hit. Because everyone around me is devastated. My old classmates are posting tributes. People are writing paragraphs about how inspiring and kind he was.

Meanwhile I’m sitting here thinking: nobody knew how much damage he caused. Nobody knows how I flinch whenever someone laughs loudly behind me. Nobody knows how long his voice echoed in my head, how many years he took from me.

I’m relieved. And angry. Angry that he never had to face consequences. Angry that I had to carry all the weight while he got to live with a spotless reputation. Angry that he died before I could ever tell him, “you fucked me up.” And yet… relieved that he’s gone.

I don’t know how to act when people talk about him like a legend. I don’t know whether I should go to the memorial service and stand quietly, or stay home and celebrate silently. I don’t think there’s a guidebook for this sort of thing.

Maybe this post is my first honest acknowledgement of what he took from me. Maybe this is the first crack in the wall I built around those memories.

Whatever.
He’s gone.

I don’t know what to do about my son’s behavior issues in school. He’s gets in trouble for not following directions/rules, body control, not completing his work, arguing with kids in his class and sometimes being violent. Before he started school a lot of different people told me he’s going to have issues because of how smart he is and I laughed it off because he IS smart so if anything that would make school easier for him right? While they’re learning how to count to 10 he can count to 100. While they’re learning how to recognize numbers 1-10 he can recognize and write numbers up to 100. They’re learning colors, he’s known his colors since he was two. The reading he was struggling with at first but he caught on SO fast. I reached out to his counselor about his behavior and she said she doesn’t think he’s being defiant it’s just that he’s so far ahead of his peers mentally and academically that he gets frustrated. I asked her if there’s anything that can be done like more challenging work and she said ask the teacher. So I did and she said he’s not ready to do anything else until he can learn to follow directions on grade level work. Which is valid but I feel so shut down. He’s NOT a bad kid and I feel like that’s all she sees. I don’t know where I’m going with this post. I’m so frustrated.

I have recently begun a relationship with someone and can slowly see myself trying to be who I was before I was depressed but I just feel off. In the last year:

• Dad dying far too early
• Having 2 weeks to find a flat with nowhere to go
•suffering a concussion 
• grandma passing away. 
• guy I liked treating me like shit and using me and deleted me because I distanced myself because I was already seeing someone else as he had stopped talking to me for 4.5 months and I feel so sad when I probably shouldn’t. 

I think it started back when dad died in December and I felt alone and angry because I felt my friends didn’t care about me. Almost a year on I still feel this was and don’t feel like I have friends because they never checked in or asked how I am and I only hear from them if I message first. I felt so alone and I was already struggling to make friends and I feel like this has made things harder. 

While I still continued doing what I normally do (hockey, work, volunteer) I don’t feel much joy. The things I loved (hockey, volunteering, record collecting) don’t bring me as much joy anymore and I hate it. I think since my concussion in August these feelings have become worse and I get so irritable so easily and frustrated and overwhelmed. It’s exhausting. Like I try to do the best I can, still do these things but that enjoyment I previously felt is gone. I’ve considered leaving volunteering because I don’t feel that joy anymore but it was something I once loved and looked forward to. Now I don’t but know if I leave, I’ll regret it at some point. 

I always hate seeking help because I’m too high functioning and I don’t feel that I get taken seriously because of it. Yes I’m still working full time but my feelings have impacted that too. I work from home most days because I’m exhausted and can’t handle being in the office, but I’m meant to be 3 days in office 2 at home. 

Sorry this is so long! Just felt like I needed to vent and didn’t have anyone to talk to. I just feel so lost and don’t really know who I am any more. I wish I could explain how i feel but can’t seem to put it into words. I’ve tried counselling multiple times and nearly all anti depressants and never feel like I get much relief so I’m hesitant to go back to counselling again. I am wondering if I will ever feel like myself anymore. I’m hoping this is just a down bit and things will get better but I just don’t know when that will be.",0.06579731,0.018645585,0.008694496,0

15064787,reddit,offmychest,1761367085,"Feel like a burden

I live very comfortably, at 22 with no education to speak of and parents that provide for me.

My parents have never asked for much from me, only that I be happy, safe and a moral person.

Spent 5 years in tertiary education studying for a degree that I neither liked nor hated, when the average person graduated in 3. I never even got my degree as I deferred a semester too many times(5) and then got advised by the course chairman to drop out and figure myself out first.

Most days I do nothing but rot away playing games, reading shitty books and scrolling on social media. It’s enviable how successful the people around me are. I used to always think the saying, ‘birds of a feather flock together’ is pretty accurate but being surrounded by family and friends that are all doing well in life makes me wonder what is actually wrong with me. 

I feel like I use my depression and anxiety as an excuse. Not only am I wasting money on medication and sessions with an overpriced psychiatrist, but I enjoy the benefits of being someone that is “sick and should therefore not be held to a higher standard. 

Being from Asia, children are looked upon to look after their parents when they’re older and can no longer look after themselves. Yet they have never held me to that, they even explicitly said that they do not want me to look after them and that they don’t want to be a burden to both my brother and I.
They have never put pressure on me when I was younger to perform academically or pushed me to do anything I didn’t want. They advise me on things in life and let me make the decision on whether I want to take that advice. 

For years I felt guilt and shame for not being good enough for them as I think that they are good parents. They provided the best they could for me even when we were poor and never neglected me. Took me out for activities together like sports and just eating out. I do think that they should have had a kid that turned out better than me. But I am what they are stuck with. I say I feel guilt and shame but I never act on them, never try to better myself, never tried to get better, never tried to pursue anything.

I’m a fucking coward and loser that has zero passion in life. If asked about what I like doing I would always say gaming and reading, but I don’t derive any joy from it, I get immersed but they are just activities to pass the time. If I can’t engage in them nothing will change in my life, still rotting away the same just with a different activity that is equally as time consuming. 

I used to keep a diary til I found out that it’s always about how fucking bad I feel and how I want to die. I know that I just want to escape, I don’t know from what either. So I stopped writing in it. My days were monotonous anyways, it wasn’t more just lying to myself about how shitty I have it when I know that’s not true. 

My parents argue somedays, I think that the root of the problem is always me. When I was young they argued about money, now they still have to argue about money. Though we are middle-class, they always have to worry about the fact that nobody will take care of me once they’re gone. They do tell me that as well, the fact that they will one day not be here, and they ask what my plans are for when that happens. I never say this out loud because I know it will hurt them but I always think that I will kill myself after taking care of their funerals. 

I keep saying I will kill myself but I’m a coward that doesn’t have the courage to do that. Because I’m a leach that is too comfortable now, there is no harm to me so I don’t change anything. 

They think that a cause for me being mentally ill is the quarrels they have when I was younger, that it impacted me hard. But I know that’s not true and I tell them so. I’m just one of those people that you might see people talk about in your community, the dregs of society, leaching off their parents even though they are able bodied and can support themselves. The ones that even I used to criticise when I was younger. Now I know it’s just hypocrisy.

I wish that my mother had a life outside of family, that she has friends and have an outlet for stress relief or fun when she needs. But she tells me that my brother and I are her pride and joy, that she is very happy caring for us and seeing us grow up. I remember telling her once that she shouldn’t have had me, the heartbreak and sadness on her face was unforgettable. She spends her days trying to think of recipes that we will enjoy, worrying about our future and keeping to herself. I overheard her telling my father that she doesn’t want to burden me with any negative things in life or accidentally nag me for fear of my emotions tanking. I hate that she has to be so careful around me. Somedays I try and sit on the couch so that she will chat with me but I’m not a good conversationalist and cannot provide the emotional connection I should. With my father at work and my brother going through puberty, I’m the only one around that she has to talk to and I hate that I can’t even do something that easy well.

I wish that my father had a life outside of work, he takes on overtime for the pay at least once a week and I know that he’s doing it just to save up for us. He has hobbies like gaming and chess as well, but the moment my brother or I wake up, he asks us what we want for food and drops what he’s doing to get it. When I was young, he would side with me against his own mother, who looked down on my mother and I, always trying to protect us. When my paternal grandmother passed, I had refused to be there til the last day of the 5 day procession, making excuses like I had academic deadlines. Both he and I knew it was excuses, that I just didn’t want to be at the funeral of someone that hated my mother and I. My mother told me after that he had a falling out with his sister then, his only living blood relative, he fought with because she criticised my absence and education. 

I cannot repay the love they give me. At 22 years of age, I have nothing going for me in life. They have to take care of my everything, my wellbeing, my emotions and my future. I keep engaging in this fantasy where I get into an accident, die and they get my insurance, enough for them to retire. 





I don’t know if I will ever come back to this post, the guilt and shame in me is always more than I can take but never enough. I am sorry for the people that have read my self indulgent sob story of a life. I write this with their argument as background music, even when they are quarrelling, they have to take care of my fucking emotions, telling each other to lower their volume just in case I hear.",0.07687678,0.032248367,0.0043657473,0

113979586,reddit,Anxiety,1762033697,"Gaba, Passion Flower and Buspar

I’ve been diagnosed with GAD and recently had a major increase in anxiety. It’s gotten to the point where I feel agoraphobic and am struggling to function. I’m currently seeing a therapist.

My doctor prescribed Buspar and said I could use it as needed for anxiety attacks, but everything I’ve read makes it sound like it needs to build up in your system and isn’t meant for PRN use. I’m hesitant to start medication in general, but I’m at a point where I have to do something because I’m a mom and this is really affecting my family.

Before starting medication, I wanted to try a more natural route. I’ve read that passion flower might be effective for anxiety. How many milligrams would be recommended for an otherwise healthy adult female (5'2"", 140 lbs, if that matters)?

I also read that it should only be taken for about eight weeks. How long should you wait before resuming it after that period? Would it make sense to alternate by taking it one week and skipping the next so it doesn’t build up too much in the system or interfere with natural chemical balance?

Lastly, which would be more effective: passion flower on its own, or the Ollie “Calm” supplement that contains lemon balm, GABA, and L-theanine?

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I really appreciate any advice or clarification.",0.025674535,0.013820915,0.0034408006,0

So an isolated incident, about 10/15 minutes ago 1.30am my daughter (23months) starts to stir, I sit up to look at the baby monitor and I am sat on edge of bed and momentarily lean down. As I’m coming back up I get a sharp pain in my left side of the chest near under ribs/sternum for a brief second. Make a comment to my partner and now my anxiety is through the roof.  I have gastritis, just had my 2 week heart monitor taken off due to episodes of in the past palpitations, pounding heart etc. I’ve had 4 ecgs this past year and various blood tests.  I’ve suffered heartburn and random on/off chest pains since march. On ppi which now seem to be helping. This is the first time in. While that I’ve wondered what was that.  Now my anxiety has kicked in. Do I need to worry? Sorry for the rambling trying to out everything into context. I am a healthy 31f, mum to two children (4 and 1), don’t smoke or drink.

I am here looking for some advice from people who have been through the system alot. My girlfriend who I live with has been clinically depressed since she was in primary school. We have been together for 3 years now and this past year she has relapsed into her ED, SH, and SI. She has been admitted to multiple psych wards and ED wards but nothing has made a lasting impact. I am aware of her SH and know where she keeps everything but every time I discuss it or take it she goes and buys more to SH. What do I do to encourage a descaling of the SH? Should I encourage putting sanitiser or something to emulate the pain without further cutting?

227160186,reddit,depression,1762373163,"Confronting myself and the past and familial trauma

Hi Everyone, this might be a long post.  Think of it as my introduction I guess.

Over the last few weeks, more and more, I have been feeling unlike myself, but in a weird way the most authentic version of myself.  What I was ""meant for"" I guess.  I am about 4k in credit card debt and going to get C's in my classes this semester (I'm a college student).  On a positive note I have quit cigarettes for 36 days after daily smoking from age 15). In the past I was diagnosed with depression through a telehealth app because I could not get out of  bed and everything felt hopeless, something to buy me time because I didn't know how to access care.  Now I am not sure that it was in fact the correct diagnosis.  I am going to meet with an actual professional in person on November 13 for an evaluation. Throughout my childhood, seeing an actual professional for anything related to mental health was considered taboo because it involved outsiders and other people would ""know"" about our family, and consequences for seeing guidance counselors was getting threatened with foster care or getting hit.

I never felt ""normal"" as a kid, and I felt different from all of those around me.  Different interest, less socialization, and a prevention from hanging out with other kids and having kids over was also in the picture.  My dad smokes weed and drinks all day and has never supported myself or my mom throughout my life, and lives off her salary and gives back nothing not working since 2000, and claiming to have taken the time off to take care of myself and my grandfather.  He claimed taking care of us to be driving around bringing us places, which I guess could be considered a form of care, however, throughout my childhood it was always myself or my mom helping my grandfather who suffered a stroke before I was born (2003).  All of these created unique circumstances, and left my Mom providing for us, while my volatile Dad would stay at home to look after me, yelling at me for 5 hours on end about something related to his fear of the internet, something I had done that he didn't like, including buy a radio for about 30 dollars, which my mom got ""in trouble"" for ""enabling"" my behavior.  I lost a lot of respect for my parents (less so my Mom) around 5 or 6 years old.  In addition to his fears about the internet, he was insistent that there was ""contamination"" from lead paint, etc. around the house so I was not permitted to walk, instead he would carry me from room to room and set me down on beds and chairs.  This wase early on in my childhood.  As time progressed, I would be able to walk around, but he was afraid of bringing in repairmen into the house for what they might ""see"" so things like losing heat, water, electricity occurred when I was about 10 years old because we had a leaking roof (think 1 1/2 foot in diameter wide) through the roof in multiple places, and in my room.  So for years, I would have to stay up and change buckets when they would overflow with water, and I would have to move my bed every few hours so I did not get rained on.  Eventually with the water damage, there were mushrooms growing out of the walls and rats scurrying around.  At the same time, he would be very overbearing on me and doing things that a good father should do, like helping me with my homework.  If I ever got the wrong answer, he would do the homework for me or would yell at till I got it right.  He would actually help me through my homework.  Other things included Ski Vacations, Hiking, outdoors activities, reading to me etc.  For context, my family was making around $160k at this time.  I am an only child.  These contrasts (like not having a place to shower, and having to use a flashlight to go the bathroom at night, no heat in the winter) combined with luxuries like slope slide ski cabins and vacations to different places really fucks with me.  Just like sometimes I'll have a great conversation with my Dad, but other times it just devolves into screaming.

Lately I kind of checked out of life, I was smoking like 5 Joints a day, while maintaining my job as a breakfast server and staying in school studying physical therapy, I plan to take an accelerated nursing program after I graduate in May (I hope).  Anyways, I have a good roommate and an ok life.  I'm trying to build myself up and go to the gym, which has been going well and I have gained a lot of muscle and fat (14 percent body fat), which were my goals, so all has been going well there.  I have my good days and my bad days, although one persistency is that cannot ""lock in"" for shit on my school assignments lately, or just in general.  Ever since I quit smoking (or maybe ever since I started weed), something has felt really off.  Like life just seems boring and I have limited interest in seeing other people and going out and making friends like I used to.  It all feels so hopeless.  For the longest time I just wanted to get fried as fuck all day everyday in my bed and have sex with people.  But now I can tell that shit is serious.  I probably fucked up for the semester and my career is contingent on grad school.  Lets hope I can pull ts off",0.08083374,0.02212623,0.016360072,0

hi,

i struggle to sleep at night because my mind is free to wander and i end up thinking about things that make me really upset and then spend hours crying instead of going to sleep . then when i feel better i lay back down to sleep and start thinking again and this cycle keeps repeating. this happens to me every single night.

right now, the only way i can fall asleep is by watching those asmr videos where the person asks you questions and you’re supposed to think about the answer in your head . they keep my mind busy while i fall asleep so i dont have the opportunity to think about stuff that upsets me

((if anyone reading this is struggling with this same issue, i recommend trying the same thing, its helped me so so much))

however, i don’t actually enjoy asmr itself at all, so i’m curious if anyone has any alternative strategies that could possibly have a similar effect and basically take away the opportunity for me to upset myself?",0.054284602,0.017088935,0.0048097214,0

Hi there! I’m a 24 yo woman, just moved in Switzerland for my Master’s with my boyfriend of 3 years. 

In the last years, I have been constantly fighting anxiety &amp; started therapy 2 years ago, sometimes it is livable, but other times (like now) it makes me feel truly helpless.

The thing is that this anxiety I’m experiencing now is so different and much stronger, feels like it embraces my entire body, I can’t sleep, eat and I cry uncontrollably, my chest hurts and it is hard to exist basically. I have been feeling like this on and off since moving here in September and this stress is starting to cause me health problems as well and I can’t keep up anymore.

My boyfriend is very supporting and understanding but (even if he doesn’t say) I feel like I’m becoming too much (understandably so) and he also has a lot on his plate right now so my anxious thoughts do not help and I’m feeling alone in all this.

I don’t know how to go through it without losing people I love or damaging my health but it feels somehow inevitable.

I didn’t answer. I don’t even know why, I was half-asleep and annoyed that he woke me up. I thought I’d talk to him in the morning.

But there was no morning with him. He took his own life that night.

I’ve replayed that moment a thousand times. What if I’d just said I love you too? What if I’d gotten up, asked if he was okay?

I’m 20F, and there’s this girl in my college — same batch — and let me tell you, she is gorgeous. I mean the kind of gorgeous that immediately catches everyone’s attention. She’s also smart academically.
I’ve spoken to her once or twice, and she seems like a chill and nice person.As someone who’s insecure about my own looks, I’ve always wished I could look somewhat close to her. I can’t help thinking this way — she’s just beautiful.

But then I see her likes on a few reels on Instagram. For example, she liked a reel showing a K-drama main lead who doesn’t really fit the “beauty standards” and is bullied for her looks, then starts wearing makeup, moves to a new school, and suddenly everyone treats her differently (if you’ve watched True Beauty, that’s the one).The captions were like, “That’s the character I mostly relate with.”
 She also likes a lot of reels about not having friends — but from what I see, she always has company, and people seem to like her.

I know I probably sound shallow, but it just makes me realize how everyone has their own struggles and hidden battles. Still, it feels odd to me… because all I ever wanted was to be pretty and have lots of friends — like being pretty would make half my problems disappear.I don’t know… are all of us just unhappy with our looks and lives?",0.09568449,0.02618698,0.014752249,0

I often feel uncomfortable, unsafe, and disconnected from myself—like I’m living life in third-person, watching everything happen from a distance. My mind feels detached, and nothing feels real. Sometimes I think I don’t deserve anything, and I just want time to pass so I can forget what I’m thinking about.

People make me anxious. I don’t like being asked questions, and when I’m upset, everyone keeps telling me to talk—but I can’t. I know exactly what I want to say, but I can’t express it. I also hate noise and crowded places. I never let people truly understand me because I act like someone else just to please them. Later, I blame myself for not being authentic when they treat me differently.

When I wake up, I often shake uncontrollably. I don’t remember where I am or how I fell asleep. Then I start overthinking—I fear dying that day. My brain never stops; it’s always thinking about everything. When I’m sad or angry, I just want someone to sit next to me silently and listen if I decide to speak.

I struggle to describe my feelings. I don’t really understand what sadness or happiness feels like anymore. Sadness seems to stay forever, while happiness fades quickly—so I’ve grown afraid of being happy. When I feel down, my first instinct used to be hurting myself to replace emotional pain with physical pain. Now, instead of that, I talk to the person I love, and that helps me calm down.

Even though I understand myself logically—why I do what I do—I still don’t understand what I feel. I’m kind to people even when I’m upset because I don’t want them to carry my sadness too. So I fake being okay, even when I’m completely drained inside. All I really want is to be stable.

I’ve had anger issues since childhood. I wish I could have talked about the problems I faced back then. My father once hit me, and I never confronted him about it. I also experienced sexual harassment from a relative when I was a child—something I’ve only ever told my partner. It still haunts me deeply.

There was another time, at a store, when my friend’s father cornered me and kissed me without my consent. I was just a kid, terrified, and I never told anyone. These memories still hurt me today.

As a child, I was jealous of my siblings because everyone used to say my sister was prettier and gave her more attention. Between ages 4–6, I acted out, but when I grew older, they became the ones teasing or hurting me. When I told my parents, they didn’t believe me. That’s when I learned to hide my emotions because no one ever took me seriously—and it still affects me now.

Whenever someone asks me “What’s wrong?”, my throat closes, and I can’t speak even though I know what I want to say. It feels like spikes in my throat. I used to fake being sick just to get attention from my parents because we were many siblings, and I wanted to feel noticed.

Sometimes I suddenly feel like I can’t breathe, especially in uncomfortable or unsafe places. I’ve had panic attacks since childhood—they’ve become less frequent, but they still scare me. When that happens, I remind myself, “It’s okay, nothing’s wrong.” These attacks often come when I feel unsafe, when someone talks about something sexual, or even when I hear words like “choking” or “tightness.”

I also have deep trust issues because of my parents and my past. They used to compliment me only to make up for the way they praised my sister more. My friends at school also broke my trust by sharing my secrets. And of course, the harassment I experienced as a child destroyed a big part of my ability to trust people.

Sometimes I wonder if anyone else feels the same way I do—because I just want to know that I’m not broken, that I’m still normal somehow.
And if anyone has ever found a way to stop feeling like this… I wish I could learn how.",0.04290464,0.019032324,0.0047727237,0

I was laying in bed recently feeling frustrated there’s no real way to get help when you’re suicidal. I’ve never been in a worse place and I don’t feel like I can truly share what I’m experiencing with anyone or get help in anyway. Friends and family are off the table because they’re half the reason I’m like this, but professional help also isn’t an option. If i walk in there and say “hey I want to kill myself” i get a one way ticket to ring around the mental health ward where no one actually helps you, they just keep you alive. You can’t even vent freely on Reddit cause mods will just delete your post if you’re in too deep (which i understand it’s just another dead end).

I’ve been stuck in this spot for six years now, after learning the hard way with an involuntary hospitalization. Usually that’s what bothers me but I’ve accepted this is just my reality, but it hit me in that moment that means i can’t tell anyone what I’m really going through.

I (29M) am not an alcoholic, but I do drink a lot on weekends. I don't drink during weekdays, but I go crazy with drinks on Friday and Saturday. I try my best to stick with either drinking on Friday or saturday; not both days. Sometimes I succeed.. sometimes I don't. 

Aside from spending ridiculous amount of money, it's also not healthy for me. I am gay and come from a homophobic family who I have nothing in common with, the bond is just not there anymore. I stay as far from them as possible. In 2018 I went through severe depression that stripped me of a lot of interests, and to an extent I still feel the same. I have very few interests. I hate my job, but I can't figure out what other possible career path I can even choose, because I literally have no interest in anything.

I feel very lonely a lot of times too, and a failure that I can't make any relationship last, I'm 29 and I have already had 5 relationships that failed. However my dating history is; abusive guy who emotionally and physically abused me, alcoholic guy, major mamas boy who financially screwed me over, one normal guy but he was on visa and it ran out so he left, and then a drug addict. I feel like my life is just a series of joke and a mess, and I don't know what I can do to not feel the way I do. Hence why I drink a lot on weekends, so I can just take some pain away and just have a break from feeling the way I do for one night! 

I absolutely hate my life and I just wish it could all end, it's not even like I can point at some things of my life and say 'these are my issues'.. its just all of it. Nothing feels right. I'm a complete and utter mess and I don't know what to do.",0.31132057,0.24424846,0.23846684,0

232272521,reddit,offmychest,1762929740,"He dumped me after discovering my past

Just want to vent out here.

I was from a long term relationship of more than 8 years when he cheated on me. I had no choice but to leave him kahit masakit. Since then, I was in a very dark place. I wanted to move on, to distract myself from the pain. Kaya nag h03 phase ako. Partied and drank almost every weekend. Nagka one night stand at fubu. I thought it was empowering as a woman, gusto ko casual lang, I was too scared to let my guard down and get hurt. It was all fun at first. Until at some point, it slowly got to me na, nakakamiss din, to feel loved and be in love. I know it sounds cliche. Syempre, I also tried to go on dates. But almost all of them, I sensed that they only wanted one thing. Ewan ko if it was for a boost of confidence nila. I don't fall short physical wise. I think age also plays a factor? I was in my early 20s that time. So guys around that age are not looking for something serious or settling down pa siguro.

It got tiring being in the dating scene. I was longing for love this time. I was tired of playing their games. I did meet a few decent guys, but due to circumstances di nag work out or tuloy. Some of the guys I talked to, were either cheaters, manyak, babaero. It got to a point that my mindset was, ""All guys are the same"". I became hopeless na kokonti nalang mga matino na lalaki.

I stopped looking for potential love cause I was losing hope and faith in men. Until I met this one guy, at the most unexpected time. He had morals and principles. Knows how to respect women, may manners, and was raised right. Straight yung priorities niya sa buhay. Not to mention, his dating/sexual history. Long term lahat. Never done any of the things I did. Ayaw ng casual. Dating to marry siya. It was because of him that suddenly, I realized, there are still guys like him out there. Then that day came, we developed feelings sa isat isa. But deep inside, I was worried. I was scared and unsure of how this would turn out. He was transparent about the type of girl he was looking for. He said I was exactly his type. Personality and physical wise. But it's not only that. What mattered to him as well, is yung past ng babae. Specifically, sexual history. He even asked me about my body count. I lied. He asked if I had slept around and had fubus, I lied. I kept lying and lying, I don't know, in my mind, he was gonna leave me if I tell him the truth. And I may never find someone like him again. I was selfish, I know. If only I had realized it did more harm than good. I was gonna pay for it in the long run. I do regret ever going into a h03 phase. It will manage to haunt me for the rest of my life. And my chance of ever finding true love one day and meeting a decent man. (It's worth noting that I already checked myself for STDs) Umabot kami ng 3 years before niya unti unti nalaman sexual history ko. He couldn't take it, and had to break things between us. Understandable naman. This was a learning experience for me. Masakit. Alam ko naman na kasalanan ko. I cannot change my past. Whats more important nalang talaga is focusing on what I can do sa present. After that relationship, I vow to work on myself and build my self worth. On what I can bring to the table to compensate. Thankful ako sa kanya kasi, if it weren't for him, di ko ma realize yung mga maling decisions na nagawa ko, yung pagiging promiscuous ko. I was able to focus on the things that mattered more, and becoming a better person. I may not the be everyone's cup of tea dahil sa past ko, and thats okay. I guess, if they truly love you, they will accept you no matter what. But, after that eye opening relationship we had, it seems my chances are slim.",0.25084448,0.08030447,0.029402243,0

183332121,reddit,offmychest,1762580704,"My mom has 42 million debt

Please help. Hindi ko na talaga alam ang gagawin ko.

Yung parents ko provincial distributor ng isang telecommunications company sa probinsya namin. Naghiwalay na parents ko 13 years ago pero sa dad ko pa din nakapangalan ang business. Yung mom ko naman ang nagmamanage. Okay ang business as in yun ang bumuhay ang nagpalaki sa family namin. Kahit na hiwalay ang parents ko, tiwala kami sa mom ko na kaya nyang ipagpatuloy ang business kasi it's been there for years. May sarili na din business ang dad ko.

Kaso just last month, tinanggal na sa amin yung pagiging provincial distributor so basically, nawala na yung main source of income and pinagkaka-abalahan ng mom ko. Sa akin okay lang kasi I have my own business na kaya isustain ang sariling family ko. Sa dad ko okay lang kasi may school and real estate business na sya. Yung mom ko yung pinakanagdudusa noon dahil wala na daw sya pinagkakaabalahan. 

But wait, there's more! Nalaman namin just last month na baon na pala sya sa utang from different people. 7 million sa isang tao, 10 million doon sa isa and 5 million doon sa isa. And just recently, nalaman ko na may 20 million pa doon sa isa. Naglabasan sila kasi worried din sila na hindi mabayaran kasi nga nawala na yung business ng mom ko. As in hindi ko alam gagawin ko nung nalaman ko yun. 

Syempre nagdaan na kami sa iyakan, sisihan at diskusyunan. Sinabi ko na dapat noong nasa 5 million palang ang utang nya at hindi na mabayaran, sinuko nalang nya ang business. Kahit nga 1 million palang, ibig sabihin may mali na sa negosyo.

Nalaman ko rin na mismanaged ang business kasi tinatanong ko sya magkano kita mo ng ganitong buwan or ng ganitong buwan, wala syang maipakita na record. Wala palang auditing na nangyayari at all. Sya yung nagnenegosyo na basta may pumasok na pera, okay na to. Tinatanong ko din kung saan napunta ang inutang nya, sinasabi nya lagi na doon sa negosyo daw. Pero tinanong ko din kung san nanggaling pinanggagastos nya personally, ang sagot nya, naghalo halo na daw kasi ang pera. So she is left with nothing na din.

Ito yung mga naging solution. Dati kasi noong na-annul parents ko, napagkasunduin na may matatanggap yung mom ko na 10 million from my dad. Wala pang nakukuha mom ko sa 10 million. So my sad decided na ibayad na lang yung 10 million doon sa isang pinagkaka-utangan. So we are left with 32 million.

Pero hanggang doon lang ang maitutulong ng dad ko kasi kung cocomputin base sa target sell-in at percentage ng profit, dapat kumikita pa din ang business. Hindi sya naniniwalang dapat malugi ang negosyo. At kung may net loss man, hindi aabot ng million.

Second solution: Pinaki-usapan namin yung mga inutangan na tanggalin na ang interest. And pumayag naman yung sa 20 million at 5 million kasi nabawi na pala nila yung principal sa interest palang! Ang problem, ayaw pumayag noong 7 million kasi last year lang pala yun nakuha. Dagdag problema pa sa amin yung 1% monthly interest, which is 70k per month.

Third solution: Pinabenta ko lahat ng pwede nyang ibenta kaso napunta lang sa overhead cost.

Fourth solution: may bahay sya na worth 2 million, sabi ko ibenta na din nya tutal sa bahay ko naman sya nakatira ngayon. I don't know kung ibabayad ko sa utang nya na may interest or bibili ako ng lupa sa real estate ng dad ko para mapalago muna. Kaso ang tagal pa nun. Baka kainin na kami ng interest.

Personally, hindi ako makakatulong financially kasi magkakapamilya na ako on my own. Buntis ako and next year ay magkakasariling anak. Sapat lang kinikita namin mag-asawa for us at kung magbabawas pa ako doon, baka possible reason pa na pag-awayan namin mag-asawa yun. Ang maitutulong ko lang ay ayusin yung isa pa nyang business na cellphone shop. Kaso noong in-audit ko yung ngayong buwan, hindi din pala profitable. Inadvisan ko na magbawas ng branch. Kaso sagot nya sakin, anong gagawin ko kung tatanggalin mo pa sakin yan?

Seems like meron syang Sunk Cost Fallacy kaya nabaon sa utang. Gusto ko syang awayin pa, sisihin and all kaso di ko na pwedeng gawin kasi lalala ang depression nya. As of now, kelangan ko din talaga alagaan yung mental health nya kasi unang mga araw no sleep and no eat sya. Napa-check up ko naman sa sleep specialist so naging okay okay na. And sabi ko nalang focus tayo sa solution. Pero sa totoo lang I'm almost giving up as well. Wala talaga akong maisip na solution.

“Thursday, Too Loud”

Thursday saunters in, sun heavy on its back
a golden brute, pressing its palm to my brow.
The air hums, thick with leftover dreams.
Lunch has passed
biscuits crumbled, coffee reheated into courage.

Full belly, restless mind.
I drift through the cluttered attic of my head,
where old thoughts chatter like gossiping sparrows
memories knocking their mugs on the table,
demanding to be noticed again.

Outside, the heat argues with the pavement.
Inside, my thoughts argue with each other.
And all I can do is sit here,
sipping the last lukewarm drop of resolve,
hoping the afternoon forgets my name.",0.04711028,0.02264188,0.0040512653,0

213682901,reddit,offmychest,1762811247,"Even though I’m an underweight adult now, I don’t think the ‘fat teenage girl’ is ever going to leave me

I never really see this specific experience discussed. But it’s basically a universal experience for anyone who is/was fat as a teenager especially girls. It’s a position that gets targeted from every direction, family, friends, strangers, media, school, clothes, doctors, social media but ultimately… it wasn’t even my fault!!!!!! I was a child!!! I was molested and neglected and bullied and using food as a coping mechanism!! The bullying just made everything worse. People justify torturing fat people by saying it’ll motivate them to lose weight and that’s just… not true for 99% of cases. I just continued using food to cope with the bullying and got fatter, and then developed a severe eating disorder as an adult when my ex cheated on me lol. Felt like confirmation of my worthlessness

In general I’m left with this feeling of intense worthlessness that I don’t know how to describe. Like I was somehow just born less worthy than everyone else. Less human. Not even just ‘feel’, it feels like an inherent literal truth even though I know logically that that’s stupid. I have to somehow earn ‘existing’, but nothing I do ever feels like enough. That feeling is never going to leave me. Ever. Losing weight didn’t help with anything. I’m the same little girl I was back then, just older and malnourished.

my boyfriend and i have been dating for three months now, we’ve known each other before this for a year. it started out great and we would spend time often. his job recently moved him from country A to B, and while we were talking prior, there were suggestions about how i can do a study abroad semester at country B so we basically moved here at around the same time. i’m only spending a semester tho

so we move here and he’s busy settling in which is totally and completely understandable. we do spend less time together. he has a really demanding job, it allows him to occasionally work remote but nonetheless it takes up long hours. he also has a business on the side which lets him travel around. for this, he was back in country A for the past month. i had some sort of an expectation that we’d at least spend the weekend together when he’s back in country B.

lo and behold, he returns but then he tells me about how he’d like to start another side gig of social media influencing based off of traveling through country B. and as soon as he’s back, he’s booked a trip to another part of the country to explore and vlog it. this got us into an argument because i was really hoping to see him but he’s off…

thing is, i have an ex who was into social media and that didn’t turn out well. he brought across the idea ages ago and i expressed my concerns but i guess he’s kind of just went ahead with it anyway

we talk about it more and he’s planned and purchased trip for almost every weekend and a couple of weekdays, and he’s able to do this because he isn’t renting an apartment right now and nomadic. and he’s pretty much done all of this without telling me. he hasn’t made any plans with me… which makes me feel he doesn’t prioritize me.

at the end of the day i’m really attracted to ambitious people, and he’s one of them. i know that dating someone ambitious means it’s going to look somewhat like this but is it justified i don’t feel like a priority. i’ll be moving back to country A soon, and considering how he’s already like this when we’re in the same country im wondering how long distance would work with him…

he also mentioned how he’s rooted here for the next five years, but keeps reassuring me that we’ll be able to see each other just bc his job requires him to be back at times

My best friend won’t save herself

For the sake of this post I’m going to use random names as there’s always a chance one of these things end up on their for you page above a subway surfers clip read by an AI voice and I really don’t wanna give everything away.


I (23f) have a best friend (25f) of what is now going on 8 years. We met in high school and worked together at the same job, and back in 2021 she moved in to my house with me and my parents due to personal circumstances. For now we’ll call her Emily. Emily started dating a guy three years ago, Mike (26m). For context, before Mike she had several boyfriends who were NOT good to her, ranging between financial abuse, cheating, SA, etc etc. when they first started dating; things were really good. But then things started to take a turn.

Last year he ended up getting kicked out of his moms house because they had recently adopted a child into the house and needed his room for the baby, and as he was the oldest and was staying over at our place a lot at the time, it ended up with him moving in with us fully. This was May 2024. In June 2024, Mike and Emily both quit their job and Emily immediately started another, while Mike didn’t have another job lined up. Mike was unemployed from June until December of last year, and during that time he became financially dependant on Emily while also contributing nothing to the house, not updating his resume, not applying anywhere. He just woke up, went on his pc, went to bed. For six months. 

Then, he got a job in December and it lasted until March, where he then quit that and he came to work at the same job as Emily. So then, they both were living together, working together, same days off, so basically together 24/7. Even before this point they were incredibly co-dependant, and this only made it worse.

It would probably make this post hit a character limit if I went into every detail of what he had done to her over the course of that year and a half, but I’ll highlight some things

- Constantly accused her of cheating and wanting to have woohoo with their coworkers, despite the fact that she again literally was never apart from him for more than going to take a piss.
- went through her phone every time she left she room and read her messages, deleted people he didn’t like from her contacts, etc 
- Would guilt and shame her any time she wanted to go do something he did not want to do, and essentially try to make her stay home with him instead of doing the thing.
- constantly made disparaging remarks about her friends, family, and myself and my family despite living in our house
- Would constantly pick fights with her at work despite her asking him to wait until they’re home and not drag personal affairs into their professional life
- Didn’t respect her opinion or consent, and would constantly answer for her or speak over her during conversations
- He would constantly give her grief over her music taste and clothing, and whenever she wanted to try something new or go back to something she used to love, he would remark about how she’s “changed.”
- Whenever he would do something he would get angry at her for if she had done it, and she called out his hypocrisy, he would always say that it’s “different” and “it’s different because you’re a woman.”
- He socially isolated her from her friends by controlling her social media presence, gave her grief until she unadded/blocked people he didn’t approve of (that he didn’t go and do that himself for), and stop spending time with people he didn’t approve of. 
- Indirectly s-shamed her multiple times. For things that could not even be imaginable or even understandable. Not that s-shaming is ever right, but it would be for things like tying the back of her tshirt with a hair tie, and constantly imply that she only does things for male attention. Also to note, the comment “well if you’re not touching me, who are you touching?” 
- in connection to previous point, for other personal reasons too private to share even like this, as well as some mental health stuff, she was not comfortable having woohoo with him for a few months, and he constantly would whine about it and say it’s different because he’s a man and she wouldn’t understand what his needs feel like. 
- He would scream at her
- he slammed objects, doors, her car door, etc whenever he got too angry
- he also would get up and go out on a walk without a word of where he’s going or when he’s going to be back.
- he would blame all of his actions on his anxiety but also refuse to take any accountability or genuinely apologize, while also simultaneously doing nothing about his anxiety. (Won’t get meds or therapy.)
- For months he would make comments about it feeling like they should break up, the relationship is doomed to fail, it’s hopeless, she’d be better off without him, etc

There’s a lot more but I genuinely wouldn’t have room on this post. He is a classic case of coercive control and emotional abuse, and I’ve tried my best to help Emily navigate it. Which also, to reiterate, I lived with them the entire time this all was happening and I worked with them at that other job too. We shared a room together, not even separated rooms, so I heard everything. 

Now, she hit her breaking point this past week. Her and Mike are going to be cut from the job soon (seasonal business) so they only have a few shifts left together, but she ended up breaking up with him before that. Now me, our friends, my family, and even his sister and cousins all agree them breaking up is a good thing because of how toxic and unhealthy things are. We have been supporting her and expressing our feelings while being considerate to her position for months. To say I wasn’t foaming at the mouth for them to break up would be a lie, but I never wanted to overstep my boundaries as a friend or make her feel pressured to break up with him, so I didn’t push for it very much even when I could see it was hurting her because I didn’t want her to get overwhelmed.

Now that they’re broken up, it’s barely been 48 hours and it already seems like she’s planning on ongoing back to him. She misses him, feels like she didn’t make the right choice, etc etc and no matter what I’ve tried it feels like my words haven’t reached her. But now I’m at a crossroads because if she takes him back, I don’t know if I’d be able to continue with things as they were. It’s like watching a friend who just got clean starting to slip again. I don’t want to abandon her or anything, I want to support her and be there for her and be as we’ve always been, but I just don’t know if I can handle being the peanut gallery for round two of Emily doormat Olympics.

340588952,reddit,offmychest,1763669027,"I was raped by hedge fund Two sigma quant (chinese) last year

I’ve been debating for a long time whether to share this, but I think my experience might help someone else—or at least give some clarity to what I’ve been carrying.

The guy who raped me was Chinese and a Yale PhD graduate. I genuinely never imagined something like this could happen with him because he seemed completely normal. Educated, polite, soft-spoken. Nothing about him set off alarm bells.

But the night he took me to his apartment, everything changed. He suddenly dragged me into his bedroom and forced himself on me. I had bruises on my upper arms for days because of how hard he grabbed me. I remember staring at those bruises in the mirror, still in shock, trying to make sense of how someone who appeared so “put together” could do something so violent.

He eventually got fired after I reported what happened, but I’m still dealing with the trauma. I’m in therapy because that night didn’t just end when I walked out of his apartment—it stuck with me.

Part of what still haunts me is the feeling that he targeted me because I wasn’t Chinese and we didn’t have mutual friends or overlapping communities. I genuinely believe he thought no one would ever find out, and that he could get away with it.

I didn’t report him immediately because we lived close to each other, and I was terrified he’d come after me. I was in shock, frozen, and honestly just trying to process what had happened. It’s so easy for people to say “why didn’t you report?” but unless you’ve been in that moment—paralyzed, confused, scared—it’s impossible to explain.

Later on, when I finally shared what happened, I received multiple messages from different people telling me they had similar experiences with him. That broke me even more, realizing this wasn’t some isolated horrible incident. He had a pattern. A hidden one.

I’m sharing this because so many of us suffer in silence thinking it was “just us,” or that nobody would believe us because the person looked respectable on paper. But predators don’t have a “look.” They don’t walk around with labels. Sometimes they’re the ones with degrees, prestigious jobs, and a mask of politeness.

Rant that I carefully put together. yikes and thanks if you read, I appreciate it.

I feel like i'm a shit person. I have acknowledged I have manipulative habits that have followed me along for a while such as how I feel enjoyment playing with people's feelings so they feel guilty or are in the wrong rather than me. 

I know by now that I try to avoid taking accountability for my actions by saying words that have subtle meanings behind them to make things sound like less or redirect it. I feel like I'm making this up since I'm a big over thinker (few years back intrusive thoughts and dreams reigned over me, but I'm doing better now) but over time I've noticed this continuous pattern that's probably true so I've decided not to ignore it. (Everything I say is around 90% true)

I've said about everything I've said on this post online before but people keep saying sociopathy???? ..but I've felt guilt many times before in my life so that's DEFINITELY a stretch. I can also be a pretty talkative and emotional person over all. This is where it gets real confusing because my emotions can go from feeling ALOT to feeling a very limited amount. Similar to my moral compass, it can go from a strict guide to suddenly not caring.

 This is like a persistent nagging I have to get off my chest and I feel like maybe I'm just a piece of shit. I always obsess over things I can't understand.

It's like all my words have a subtle meaning behind them?? Sometimes I just naturally feel like doing it. I'm always seeking out attention I have no clue why, I just always want it. And what's worse? I don't want to drop my bad habits, they benefit me and I understand they're morally wrong but I just don't feel the need to even though I should. It's an odd thing to admit, but I won't lie and say it's easy.

Even when I was younger, I would ask if my friends would do anything for me even if I wouldn't do the same back for them. I was often left out a lot when younger so I feel like I naturally attempted to hold onto my friends tighter, not because of the reason of liking them - but for the sakes of having people favour me.

I constantly try to mirror others to have people like me unless I'm tired, then I feel like my mask just slips (I can then come off as quite rude/uncaring) and I just can't be bothered which just looks like me having mood-swings to others. I can't stand the idea of being disliked.",0.40614098,0.2659317,0.041003603,0

I've never had family issues til this year.
I wouldn't say we were a super happy family because we would barely spend any quality time, but I thought we were normal.

And then I found out that my dad was porn addict who subscribes to dating websites (he literally pays for that shit monthly lol) that have scammers sending pictures to him.
The worst thing is that when I've just found this out, my sister was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and she hasn’t been well since this February. 
We sent her to the psych ward but it didn't help and she's still crazy.

I know I sound very arrogant and avoidant to talk like this about my family, but I am just genuinely tired and I've never been so depressed til now.

I am also having my first relationship this year, and I realized I want to build a happy family with someone in my life. But I'm not sure if I would even be capable to achieve that, since my family is broken and I am just exhausted with everything that's going on with my life right now.

I'm only 21. I want to be saved but I know that nobody can save me except for myself. How can I deal with my family issues and eventually get better when it comes to my mental health?",0.47886392,0.40243408,0.17847598,0

I'm just so freaking excited. I've been to therapy and learned to identify and manage my weird feelings towards relationships by treating it like OCD (it probably is OCD lol). Stop performing checks, one event does not guarantee another; use your feelings and not those mental compulsions, you idiot. I didn't even know I was doing those things, so it was hard to figure out the problem.

This week I made out with someone for the first time in about two years, a guy I really like in a friend group that formed recently. We were playing games in his room, and it just got to a point dude. I actually shut him up by kissing him, something I've always wanted to do hahah. And then I let out the biggest dumbest fucking moan. Nothing like that's ever come out of me by accident before.😭

I thought I had a broken brain that could never enjoy love. Every time I was exhausted and terrified by the whole thing. Now I know it's something I can escape from. My effort is WORKING. I literally just enjoyed myself that evening. I didn't know I could do that.

I can feel the mental compulsions making all kinds of incorrect assumptions about how all this will go. I used to listen to it, but now I won't. All that matters is right now!!!!!!!!! And right now I want to kiss him again!!!!!!!! He seems to really like me too, so for his sake I will continue to work hard on this. If it doesn't work out, it *will not* be because of my ""OCD.""",0.41168427,0.40243408,0.030691283,0

But i told her i honestly cant due to everything going on outside my mind. After some discussion we came up with a safety plan and of course I gotta show up next week for therapy. Also told my parents about it and well they understood for the most part thankfully. Idk i have very mixed emotions about it. I think it was a good wake up call for me cause it really has motivated me to put more work in to get better. I know that’s easier said than done. It’s just scary to see myself this low.

354584904,reddit,offmychest,1763768812,"I hate being a loner but people make me feel lonely

I'm a 37 yo m and I have been lonely my whole life. I'm the youngest of 3 and my siblings are 4 and 6 years older than me. We get along now but growing up, I was left out  a lot. My siblings protected me but  made it clear they didn't want to do much with me. I'd like to say it was age but my brother would  take my cousin that was my age with him on hikes and leave me out.  I grew up up in a very rural and racist town and was the only black kid in my neighborhood. There was another boy (white) around the same age as me and I tried being cordial and making friends but he never seemed interested. My  mother worked her butt off at times having 4 jobs at times leaving me and my sister alone.  We didn't get along much so I spent most of my time online in forums and chat rooms. All my friends were online but I  was still kind of the outsider.

 I had cousins I could hang with once or twice a month but when I was home I just felt so alone. My mom worked her way into a decent paying corporate job and whenever I'd go with her to parties or events with coworkers  I was the only black boy. None of the boys would play with me and I played it off when their parents would ask. I was the darkest of my cousin's and usually ended up the butt of their jokes so I started finding more comfort in solitude. Gaming, making music, and social media were my life and it was comfortable. 

I came into my own in high-school and was a bit of a social butterfly and made two friends that I hung with all the time. I went off to college and they weren't so fortunate so we kind of drifted apart. I made two more new friends in college but we live in different states now and communication is minimal. In my younger friendships, I was the guy with things.  I was the one with a car. I was the one with his own place. I was the one who could pay when they didnt have. I don't  necessarily feel used because they reciprocated things in their own way. However, now that we are all semi successful or at least self sufficient, I hear less from everyone. I always noticed that once my ""benefits"" were no longer needed, people didn't come around as much.
 

I made friends at my job but was the odd man out. We all used to hang out on our lunches and go to bars together but I found out I wasn't invited to things. Someone in our group got married and I was the only one not invited. There were many other events that I wasn't invited to either. I heard a few of them talking about me one day when they didnt know I was close by. It hurt my feelings but it wasn't a new thing for me.  I gathered up the courage  to come out as bi to the guy i thought was my best friend in the group.   He said he was proud of me but stopped communicating with me as much after that. He was my bestfriend but I guess I wasn't his. I just stopped reaching out to everyone and once again withdrew to myself. 


At one point I just thought it was me but I have been a solid  guy. I'm far from perfect and know i have flaws but I don't talk about people when they are not around and always try to be kind. I have really bad adhd and a bit of dyslexia so sometimes I say dumb things and am sure thats a part of it. However, I am a fairly cerebral guy amd most of the time people came to me for advice or help. I'm always giving, checking in on people to make sure they are OK. I'm there whenever someone is moving, doing large projects for their home,  or is going through something. I went through the hardest time of my life when my ex cheated on me, made me out to be the bad guy for everything but admitted it was all her behind closed doors, and i nearly had a psychotic break. No one called, visited, or checked in on me. 


Everything I've experienced made me think solitude was the right choice. I just expect people to be people. I don't harbor resentment or anger towards anybody and would still be there to help them in a heartbeat. I always try to stay happy. I smile and joke a lot because I want everyone around me to be happy and will continue to be that way. I only occasionally feel sad or depressed when my kids from my previous relationship aren't around.

 I know and accept that life is what it is  but my experiences have slowly calloused me over time making me feel safety in solitude. I've been abandoned and  betrayed too many times for my liking. Getting close to people makes me anxious but I'm still down to try. Sometimes  I feel like I'm just a glutton for pain but I can't help but try to find the good in everyone.",0.32128486,0.12883772,0.32184324,0

36926327,reddit,Anxiety,1761520527,"Tips for overthinking?

At the beginning of the year, I had a panic attack because of a THC edible; it was the first panic attack of my life. Before the panick attack My anxiety manifested physically: biting my nails, restlessness… Mentally I was always “calm” even when anxious. After the panic attack, I realized that I’m overthinking, always thinking too much and always worried about everything. Sometimes I can’t quiet my mind. This is bothering me because I can’t focus on anything I do anymore. Sometimes my head starts playing random songs…
Is there any tip to stop these voices and this overthinking? Or only with medication? I believe that after the panic attack my nervous system became deregulated…",0.044388983,0.018838953,0.00449524,0

48236102,reddit,offmychest,1761600687,"My boyfriend said it was ok to go to my work’s Christmas party and now he’s starting a fight over it

I (26f) go nowhere. I’m LDR with S (33m) and I spend all of my free time either with him (usually gaming or watching YouTube) or reading books or sleeping. That’s it. 

I’ve worked at my company for 3 years and I’ve skipped on the last two Christmas parties due to anxiety and also wanting to spend the Christmas period with my loved ones instead but this year, due to getting closer to some coworkers and just also wanting to try and put myself out there, I decided I wanted to go. 

I back and forth-ed on it for a while and ended up asking S if he would be comfortable with me going. He assured me that as long as I didn’t drink too much and came home instead of staying at a hotel, he’d be ok with it. I don’t drink and I also don’t like sleeping in a bed that isn’t mine if it’s not absolutely necessary so I can very easily keep that promise. 

For the last two weeks, I’ve been trying to figure out what to wear. The dress code is formal/black tie with a mix of Christmas glamour so think just pretty sparkly evening gowns and suits. I have three dresses in my wardrobe that I’ve never worn - two of which are very form fitting and sparkly but aren’t inappropriate. They’re classy and you’d expect them to be worn at the venue under the circumstances. I tried both on for S and he said he didn’t feel comfortable with me wearing either. 

The third dress is a 50s style circular dress that just doesn’t fully fit the vibe and also doesn’t fit me properly anymore due to weight loss and we both agreed no. 

So, I spent HOURS finding a new dress that S liked and we settled on a red satin dress with a low back and cowl neckline. I sent him TONS of options and that was the one he picked. Just to make it clear. 

It came today and I tried it on and showed S. I wasn’t fully happy but I made some temporary adjustments and ended up really liking it. S didn’t really say much which struck me as weird because he usually compliments me a lot when I’m trying things on for him. 

S is now at work and hasn’t been texting me as much as usual. Fine, he’s probably busy. So I’ve been just bugging his DMs like I usually do. 

About ten minutes ago, he texted me to say:

S: I can’t believe you’re going to wear any of those dresses to a work dinner 
Me: wait what?
S: would you like it if I was dressing up to go to a work party? 
Me: i wouldn’t mind if the event was black tie what are you going on about 
S: what about if I was surrounded by girls in those dresses of yours how would you like me going then? 

At this point the conversation got heated and he pretty much told me he doesn’t think I should be trying to dress nicely and thinks I’m trying to impress people? Which is so dumb when the invite says it’s formal wear and glitzy and glamorous. I got mad at him because I spent money I don’t have on this new dress that he said he’d be ok with me wearing. He just started to say how I wouldn’t be comfortable if he went somewhere all dressed up so why should he be and why do I want to show off my body to people in the first place. Just absolute bullshit. 

I have consistently told him if he doesn’t want me to go, I’m happy to respect that and not go. I miss everything to spend time with him so it wouldn’t bother me. He has kept saying he’s fine but now after I’ve spent money on a dress HE picked out for me, he has a problem? 

I told him if he isn’t comfortable with me going he has to tell me tonight so I can back out before it’s too late or I’m going to have to go whether either of us like it or not. 

He won’t text me back now and I’m laying here not knowing wtf to do. 

Why couldn’t he have been honest from the start so I could have said no? If he makes me bail now I’ll have wasted peoples time and money and I’m so upset he basically insinuated my dresses are inappropriate. 

I really fucking hate him right now. We’ve been on such a great run for weeks and it felt like our relationship was finally at a turning point and now he’s back to starting arguments with me and stonewalling me again.",0.07450261,0.021094928,0.011839314,0

Also one of the most important things is to be open to communication and actually hearing / acting on what your partner is saying could be wrong. Use your intuition to determine if they&#039;re just being an asshole, but most women will think they&#039;re always in the right and it&#039;s the man&#039;s job to change when a lot of times it truly is the opposite.

Last thing I can say is both you and your partner should contribute &quot;equally&quot; but in different ways. You need to take your place as the caregiver and homemaker if you want to be a mom without expecting your partner to do a 50/50 split in chores and housework while he works to provide that home. And your partner shouldn&#039;t expect you to get a job while also being the primary person raising your child / taking care of the home. It&#039;s a lot to take in, and a lot of work to find that balance but it&#039;ll never be completely perfect; you just have to use your intuition to determine how to take action.

328741559,reddit,offmychest,1763600317,"I don’t enjoy being married anymore.

I (28f) have been married to my husband (39m) since 2023 and we’ve been together since 2020. He was married previously and has a child from his first marriage. I hesitated during every “milestone” of our relationship before marriage- making it official, moving in together, getting engaged, and even having a wedding in the first place. My gut told me I wasn’t ready, but, I thought that it would be okay because I knew he was a good person and a good parent. We struggled sometimes with communication and with being accountable with chores or budgeting, but otherwise felt really solid. 

It’s now 2025 and I realized today that I am absolutely exhausted in this marriage. I carry the mental and physical load of chores, budgeting, groceries/meals, and everyone’s emotional well being. Basically, if I don’t do it or ask for it, it doesn’t get done. Sometimes if I do ask for it, it’s done carelessly or isn’t completed or just not with consideration. For example, I was out of town this weekend when a package came in and he texted that it had arrived in a damaged box. I asked him to check and make sure there was nothing wrong with the contents, which he did. But he also threw away the box, the instructions, and in turn, a vital piece of the product that it can’t function without. Honestly, the piece is replaceable- but the carelessness is what has me frustrated. 

On top of all of this, when I bring up wanting things to change in any capacity, even just a suggestion on how something could be put away in a more optimal spot, he shuts down completely and takes it as a blow to his character. In any moment of feedback or conversation, even if it’s solely about my emotions, I find myself comforting him by the end of the conversation with no resolution to my end of the situation. 

I am in no way “perfect”- but I work on myself through therapy and reading materials on relationships (as someone in the therapy field, I learn best this way). I don’t feel that any progress has been made since the first time my unhappiness about the load I feel I am carrying was expressed- and it’s come up time and time again. 

Honestly, I’m not looking for advice. I know there are basically two ways to go: I end it completely and give up, or I offer opportunities to grow and see if it helps…which has proven unsuccessful thus far. I guess I just want to get it out, maybe see if I’m not alone in this.",0.058737632,0.021546122,0.0102854045,0

I'm tired of being his mother and I'm tired of doing everything. He has a really good job and is financially stable, and thinks that's doing his part in the relationship and he doesn't have to do anything else because of this. He never feels good, takes 'naps' (watch porn) all the time, and plays hours of video games. But he doesn't feel good enough to help me do one or two things around the house when I ask because I am tired.

I'm too old to do anything about it. I can't move. I can't buy my own house. Obviously he's just here because it's easy for him because he's not capable of taking care of himself.

I&#039;d been hearing about 7oh a lot so decided to give it a try and it was love at first dose.

I don’t even know where to start. But I’ve hated my mother for years now. I’ll start by saying she can sometimes be super sweet, caring, kind, and selfless. And that’s what I sometimes love her for. 

The vast majority of her is just being the most degrading, awful, unreasonable, irritating piece of shit so much. 

She’s an alcoholic and always lets emotion get ahead of her. Shes never had an ounce of reasoning and always pulls the most stupid shit out of her ass. Being mad for things that happened years ago and taking her anger out on me. 

I’ve got a distant older brother but I’m pretty much an only child as it was mostly me and my mother growing up. Growing up I remember her being really affectionate but stern when she had to be, she was a good mother. And I was proud to have her as my mother. 

Things changed when I grew up and I couldn’t be her little boy anymore, had dreams, was figuring out the world on a personal level. No more spoon feeding. 

She hates that premise, I’m reaching adulthood very soon now and she still sees me as a kid. She has no notion of me having a conversation with her and disregards everything I talk about, whether my hobbies or interests. So I gave up long ago. 

She then has the gall to say I never speak to her and she’s so lonely and “everybody hates her” when I’ve tried speaking to her numerous times though it always ends in fights. 

I just noticed her getting alot more belligerent over the years. Sometimes I wish she’s just die. Shes said herself that “I’m nothing”. “I’m an idiot”. “I’m disgusting” when I never even bother her or ask for anything. I only need a small sum of money weekly to simply survive. 

I don’t ask for much. I’m a really simple dude, but my own mother doesn’t know what kind of person I am because she’s never tried to figure it out. She’s always fucking assuming what I like, what upsets me. Says she feels sad for me when she has no idea what I’m feeling. I hate how she sees me as her child and not a person. 

I could be at the worst time of my entire life and she wouldn’t care. I could be at the best time of my life and she wouldn’t care. But when something upsets her she assumes it upsets me and then she feels “so bad for me”. 

She disgusts me in every way possible. 

I know this all isn’t much of anything but I really needed to atleast get a quarter of my thoughts out somewhere. 

I hate her.",0.7675452,0.6336687,0.2964622,1

I don't know what I'm feeling right now. I have this extreme feeling of loneliness all the time for the past 2 years to the point I was mostly numb to it. Once in awhile this feeling overwhelms me and I crash, I start silently tearing up and I start getting mad of my inability to control my emotions.

 I was doing mandatory service for my country of nationality (mandatory military for 2 years like South Korea), I got ripped away from my parents and long time friends in the states. Once I learned to get over the fact that I have to restart my social circle in the country I'm serving, I started getting really good friends and It was one of the best periods of my life until I finished my 2 years of service, I had to let go of them knowing that I probably will never see them anytime soon. I came back home and everyone's changed, my close friends have jobs now, my circle of people had gotten relationships, some of them left the circle and never came back.

I truly realized how lonely I am when I scroll on socials and all of them are having fun doing Halloween things and there's me, going to the gym alone on Halloween. I have never felt so isolated from people. Those 2 years helped me be the independent person I am today but it also made me feel so much more alone than I was before.

The new group of friends I have now I can never truly connect with them the way I connect to all my past friends and people. I tell one of my current friends about how I feel and he gave me all these advices that sounds good and perfect but it didn't help at all.

I have never been diagnosed with anything mental so I don't wanna say I'm depressed without actually being depressed, I understand that there's probably a lot of people having harder lives than me. Idk.. I just felt an overwhelming feeling of loneliness, questioning myself everyday ""what should I do right now to kill time"", I go on hikes, I go fishing, I hit the gym, those activities felt good at the time then I right back to feeling lonely afterwards. I also no longer find joy in things I used to like: games, playing music, watching anime and random stuff, I also no longer feel any emotions to activities I dread like doing college work, studying. Everything is just numb like I'm just spending time just for the sake of passing time. I'm still physically healthy, workout and eat healthy every single day. I still function perfectly talking and joking to others and having fun.

Anyone that has dealt with extreme loneliness, I would appreciate advices and ways to cope, thanks.",0.22311419,0.06739554,0.10221587,0

Visitors interact with your store through a web browser or mobile device. The browser talks to your NGINX web server, which routes requests to Django. Django runs your Python logic, handles authentication, and communicates with MySQL to read and write account or app data. Payments flow through PayPal-s API, which lives outside your server and handles all card security.<br>2-- The Web Frontend<br>Your frontend is the public-facing part of your store - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lists your apps (Nutrition, Emojis, Paid Filters, Media Editor, Horoscopes, Charts, and your Video Game) and lets users register, log in, view profiles, and make purchases. When a user clicks -Buy,- your JavaScript code makes an API call (using fetch() or Axios) to your Django REST API endpoint such as /api/create-order/. This frontend never touches the database directly; it always goes through Django-s secure APIs.<br>3-- Django Application Layer<br>Your Django server is the heart of the system. It defines URL routes, business logic, and API endpoints using Django REST Framework. Django authenticates users, manages sessions, and connects to your MySQL database through Django-s ORM. When an API request arrives, Django checks credentials, reads or writes data, and formats a JSON response for the frontend. Django also contains app-specific logic - for example, retrieving a user-s Horoscope data, storing Media Editor filters, or managing saved game scores.",0.024142517,0.014276917,0.0074365693,0

My girlfriend brought home a rescued dog and she is taking advantage of my sense of responsibility of always being the one to give in so that she does not have to do the things that she has an obligation to do. She has always wanted a dog but I don’t, at least not yet. Not that I don’t like dogs, in fact I love dogs and had one during childhood but my life is a bit hectic this year and I really don’t want to bear the extra responsibility of owning one just yet. 

We aren’t exactly disciplined people and I really think we should develop this area before we move forward and do some life changing things such as owning a dog. Right now we live in my home where all the expenses are paid by me. I thought it was only only fair that she pays for the expenses (e.g. vet bills, food, supplements, others) of the dog since she should have more extra money to spend and overall less burden than I do. It’s not that I don’t want to have anything to do with the dog, but I don’t think I should be held accountable such as splitting 50/50 on the dog expenses and be the one to do all the tasks that she doesn’t want to do such as cleaning up the urine/feces mess left in the house. My role is to be the one that will help out passively and I am willing to help every way possible but I just don’t like her attitude towards all this especially when I sat her down for a talk multiple times on how I don’t think we are ready for a pet. I even had foresight that this would happen just judging from the way she handles everything else aside from the pet.

Now that the dog has been here for 8 days, my predictions have turned true as she is pushing all the responsibilities that she doesn’t want to bear onto me and is constantly trying to coerce me into forking the bill on some of the expensive vet bills and food expenses. She even threw a tantrum when I refused to walk the dog with her last night even after I expressed that I need time to finish up my work and would need her donit alone.

We had an argument just now as the dog peed onto my hard wood floor really early in the morning and all she knew how to do was stand there asking me questions. Instead of pitching in to help out, she goes right to bed.

Most infuriating thing I heard her say is.. ”then why did bring home a dog..” Well I didn’t want to, you brought her home without my full consent, and if you did you agree to full ownership and responsibility and that my voluntary contribution should not be taken for granted.",0.05255287,0.020708188,0.0056236745,0

89494,reddit,Anxiety,1760823832,"15+ Years of “Dysautonomia""? Exercise or Cold Exposure Triggered

37 M. First heart palpitation at 17 — scared the life out of me.
At 23–24, during heavy training, I started waking up at night feeling like I was dying or suffocating. Since then, same pattern: during intense exercise or sudden cold exposure (cold shower, sauna→lake), I get this overwhelming sense my heart can’t handle it. Strong lump in throat, urge to take deep breaths (feels relieving), racing heartbeat, and pure panic like my body’s shutting down.

All tests are spotless: 4x Holters, at least 6 echocardiograms and 7x stress tests, blood pressure monitor, bloodwork — all normal.
Palpitations decreased after quitting nicotine but still show up on bad training days.
If I warm up slowly, I can prevent it sometimes.
Had one POTS-like episode recently (tachycardia/dizziness for about an hour). Called ambulance.

Seen 10+ doctors — cardiologists, neurologists, GPs — said something among the lines ""you are fine it's just stress""...
Given the triggers and clean heart results, this sounds like dysautonomia or maybe anxiety. 

Anyone here had the same reaction to exercise or cold?

Did anything actually help calm your system down long-term?

117687094,reddit,offmychest,1762090613,"Is My Former Roommate a Psychopath? (Serious question, please no rude comments)

Hi everyone. I’m not a native English speaker — I studied at an Asian university — but everything I’m saying here is true. I just want to describe what happened and ask for opinions about what kind of person this might be.

**1. Borrowing the Phone**  
One time he borrowed my phone. I lent it and stood nearby, not really thinking about it—maybe I did want it back a little because I was going to bed. He looked straight into my eyes and said, “You’re hoping I’ll give it back to you, right?” The tone and stare felt off. I froze, and he repeated it, then gave a slight, curling smirk—as if he had “caught” me.

The message under the words was: *“You’re not as generous as you pretend. I can read your mind, and I’ve just exposed you.”* It felt like gaslighting and a test: when I hesitated, he seemed to take that as proof I was easy to manipulate. This wasn’t an isolated line; it fit a broader pattern. In daily life he was very stingy—he often said, “People are all selfish”—while I’m generally open and willing to help. That contrast is why the same sentence, with that eye contact, tone, and repetition, didn’t land as teasing. It felt targeted.

**2. The Exercise Incident**  
I’ve been weak since I was young, not very strong physically. Once, I tried to lift a water bucket but couldn’t. He didn’t say anything then, but that night he suddenly said, “Woman’s arms.”  
Later, I started exercising, just to improve my health. He probably knew I was working out. One day, I casually showed him my arm — just in a normal, friendly way — and he suddenly said, with a sly tone, “You’ve been secretly training, huh?”  
I froze, not knowing how to react, because I’d never met anyone who said things like that. When he saw my reaction, he looked even more pleased with himself and repeated, “Secretly training, huh,” as if he had once again exposed my inner thoughts.

**3. The Exam Incident**  
Before one exam, I said, “What if I fail this time?” — just talking to myself. The microphone wasn’t even pointed at him. But he suddenly said sharply, “\[My name\], I’m telling you, I don’t care whether you fail or not!”  
He said it in a heavy, almost biting tone, like he was gritting his teeth. I froze. Then he repeated it again, dragging the words out maliciously. I felt very uncomfortable, almost confused. Then he acted like nothing had happened, as if we were still fine, even watching a football game together later.

**4. The Joke Incident**  
Once, I made a simple joke — just an ordinary one. Suddenly, he became extremely angry, like an injured animal. His voice is usually thin, but at that moment he almost roared, “How dare you!”  
I froze again, and he repeated it once more.

**5. The “Murderer” Accusation**  
Later, when we weren’t very close anymore, he suddenly said thoughtfully, “\[My name\], do you think you’ll become like AAA?”  
AAA was a famous murderer who killed his roommate after a small argument — everyone in that country knows about the case. When I didn’t respond, he repeated it again.

**Other Incidents (Not About Me)**

**(a) The Girl’s Teeth**  
Once, we went out to take photos with a girl who doesn’t smile showing her teeth. Later, after we got back, he asked, “Why doesn’t she show her teeth when she smiles?” Someone answered, “Maybe her teeth aren’t good.” Then he said, “So what? My teeth aren’t good either, but I still smile happily!” That was it.

**(b) The Suicide Talk**  
Once, for some reason, the topic of suicide came up. He said, as if talking to himself, “I just can’t understand. Our teacher said, if you have the courage to die, why don’t you have the courage to live?”  
He kept repeating it, not really to discuss it. Later, as if suddenly realizing something, he said, “Ah, I know now — it’s pressure!”

That’s just a small portion of all the things that happened . I had never met someone like this before, and it made me very uncomfortable. These things are already in the past — I’ve left the school — but I still want to ask everyone what you think.

102863041,reddit,offmychest,1761996096,"I’ve been holding this in for years. I need to let it out.

Hi, this is my first time posting anything on any social media, but I really need to get this off my chest. My life feels like it’s been one long battle, and I just want to put it into words.

I was born and raised in a strict, well-to-do Southeast Asian family. I’m 19, 5'7"", and a bit obese. I’ve been taunted about my short stature and weight since I was young. I didn’t play any sports, learn any art forms, or pick up any instruments, my parents said all that was a waste of time. They made me study, and only study. I had to be the topper at school.

My classmates made fun of me, and even my parents and siblings sometimes said things that hurt. But it was all okay because I had one best friend. He was the only other A+ student in my grade, and my parents approved of him because of that. He was kind and smart. We studied and laughed together, and though I never told him my problems (I didn’t want to burden him), I felt like he understood me.

My main fear is my dad. First it started with his employees. He hurled verbal abuse at them day and night. He never works out, he is shorter than me, he gets uncontrollably angry at the drop of a hat, he doesn't pray properly, doesnt wake up on time. Yet he taunts and scolds me if I slack, even if it isnt slacking. He insists on the stupidest things, like asking ridiculous puzzles that make no sense and then get angry if you disagree with his ""logic"". He once beat me because I was seeing some youtube shorts while on a break when I was studying for my mid-terms. He smashed my laptop and started shouting at me, saying how wished such a terrible child shouldn't be born to anyone. How he wished I was dead, rather than decieving my parents, because they thought i was studying. He has a lie detector, but he just assumes youre guilty and you have to accept you were doing what he accuses you of or it gets worse. Like all times when he catches us doing bad things or ""lying"", he becomes unpredictable and after he has vented out his initial anger, I have to go to him to apologise. I scored 91% in my midterms that year, but he never apologised. 

I have to report everything I do, whom I met, who're my ""friends"", when I'm going to uni, when i'll be back. They go through my phone and stuff, so I burn my diaries everytime i complete one. I have no privacy. I have to be orthodox, follow stupid beliefs and customs I don't care to follow, keep my beard and body hair and laugh at the misogynistic and unempathetic jokes they make. My parents lack empathy, just enough to get by. I'm trapped, because if I fight, I'll be in a much worse position.

One day when i was in year 11, he was force feeding extra breakfast my sister to the point she was crying. I said with a stern but suggestive tone to let her be if she doesnt wanna eat more. I was slapped so many times that day for ""raising my voice"" that i still have a loose pre molar on that side. 

When I was in year 6, I got 72/80 on my English exam. But i was scared of my parents. So i hid it. My best friend's mom called that evening for the first time ever. She was bragging about him getting 79 and asked if my mum was happy with mine. That evening I was slapped till I could only hear the ringing. Through my tears I nodded when my father told me I must not hide anything from my parents, even if I get beaten up for it. 

In year 11, as I was going through puberty I started lifting. I had this newfound confidence, in doing something that i loved. My mom forbade me from weight training, saying people die from it and she didn't wanna hear other wise. My dad took my deepening voice and mood swings as a challenge. He beat me up every now and then, whenever he found my ""tone"" disrespectful. Now I speak in a higher pitch. I stopped using my real deep voice. He mustve thought I was just I was getting ""bold"", but being old-minded, he doesn't understand puberty hormones, much less relationships and mental health. I can't even think about getting a girfriend. They won't allow me to date because marriages need to be arranged and if they sniff you dating, they might actually unalive me.

I used to love painting. I could draw animal anatomies very well. My parents saw it as a time waste. They said they did not want to see me painting except 30 mins on saturday.

 My mother once made us stand outside at night in the dark, because I kept losing my eraser. I wet my pants that night, but I don't remember any warmth from her.

Lately, my dad has started dumping his business work on me, keeping logbooks, organizing hundreds of files, tracking payments, because he hires unqualified people yet boasts about having 25 employees “he picked from the side of the road"" and turned into ""excellent workers"". I’m struggling to balance his workload with my own university course. I have no time to go out or make friends. I can't go out even if I make friends because thats what ""bad children"" do.

I dont like being at home, going out with them or call them, because these are the only memories that i have. We had good times too but I dont remember much.

But these days, I have been going through a very difficult patch in life. Naturally the only person I ever share the few thoughts and emotions that I do with is my friend. So i called him a week and a half ago. But he got angry, saying that I'm always self doubting. I wanted him to guess my MBTI (I just got to know what it was), but he said he's the only one who would be friends with me, yet I am always testing him. I didnot want to say anything that might hurt him, so I just said goodnight and hung up. A couple days later, we were on another call, and I thought he might be willing to listen to me this time, maybe he was going through something too. But the first thing he demanded I apologize for making him angry and to persuade him to even talk to me again. It's the first time I heard him say something like that in the 10 years we've been friends. I was so hurt, that I said I needed space. I haven't texted him or called him in a week. He was the only person I trusted, my only safe space. But its so bleak now. I don't know how I'm going to get through college. I’m surrounded by familiar faces, but nobody I truly know. 

I don’t know how to keep going sometimes, but I’m trying. Writing this is the only thing that makes sense right now.

469603084,reddit,offmychest,1764536204,"I Don't Know What To Do

At the beginning of June, my husband discarded me like a bag of garbage. It was sudden, it was cruel, and none of it made sense to anyone who knew both of us. Not his family, not mine, not our mutual friends. No one. I had noticed his withdrawal earlier in the spring, but he said it was nothing and we went about our business as usual. Our wedding anniversary (1 year, mind you) was pretty meh at best and the vacation we had planned at the end of that month as a belated honeymoon was disaster. He was in a horrid mood the entire time, he looked at me with disgust the only time we had sex (coincidentally, that was the last time we had sex) and overall just was withdrawing from me. 

  
He has a lot of outside shit going on between a high-conflict ex-wife he has to coparent with (he has four kids that I have loved as my own for the last five years) and a violent autistic son. That's just the top two issues, so I thought he was maybe just overwhelmed with it all and we needed some time apart. 

  
I moved the majority of my things out of the house 4th of July weekend. Our house. And the only reason I left was because he threatened to live on the streets if I didn't go and I know a mental health breakdown when I see one, and I didn't want that for the kids. I still have at least one full room of things at our house, I am still on our joint cell phone plan, I still have keys to the house... and I have been maintaining idle hope that we would reconcile. 

  
I want to clarify, he is not a narcissist, though the internet loves that term. He's been acting shameful and hiding not just from me but from most of his family. I have suspected since August that he had another woman on the side and it turns out that my intuition was correct. He moved this woman into our house not long after I left, introduced the kids to her (and my step-daughter texts me regularly about how she misses me and why did I leave), and has been trying to bring her around to the family. 

  
I know his family does not support this. They talk to me regularly. They are how I have confirmation of this. Apparently this woman works with him and speaks very little English. They have to use translation software to speak to each other. We all suspect that he was trying to justify his affair by coming up with petty reasons to separate from me. 

  
I don't know how to come back from this. I want to confront him, but don't because of the kids. They do not deserve this. I don't have the money for an attorney on top of working to get a new apartment (I've been couch surfing with a friend since June, but this is not a long term solution) that allows my animals. I feel sick, stupid, and confused. He is not acting like the man I married. HIs family doesn't understand what he is doing. 

  
I haven't talked to my friends about this because I don't want to make an already shitty situation worse, but I feel so gross. I am successful, I have a great job and I make way more money than he does now. I don't know how to reconcile the man I married, the man I lived with for 5 years and was very much in love with, against whatever he is doing now.",0.25915736,0.16989174,0.011321344,0

403712232,reddit,offmychest,1764102613,"My Confession to QuarterJade

First I wanna apologize in advance to anyone who has to read this, but I have to let my feelings out somehow lest I burst from the inside.

Jodi, the way I long for you cannot be healthy. Every night I’m getting tortured with the desire to have you. I know it’s wrong, and I know I’m wrong, but that doesn’t stop my heart from hurting me.

I do know I should avoid looking at you at this rate, and I try, but curiosity gets the better of me, and it always ends in the same way: pain.

You’ve got the most beautiful smile I’ve ever seen. Every time I see you smile or laugh my heart flutters.

I like the way your eyes squint whenever you smile.

Everything hurts. My mind and my heart. Even physically I can feel the pain.

I want to go after you, even if you’re in a relationship, and even though I know it’s wrong. I want to start a harem of ten women with you as my number one woman.

The rest in order are:
Valkyrae, iGumdrop, Fuslie, Ariasaki, Lilypichu, Hyoon, Cinna, xChocobars, Fanfan

Logically, I know it’s unrealistic. But no matter how many times I tell myself this or distract myself, I keep thinking of you. It’s as if all I do everyday is meant to please you, even though you don’t even know me.

I’m such a creep. I’m so confused. The emotional pain is so intense.

I probably need a therapist.

I want to be so rich, and have a giant mansion, and have all of us living there, with me giving you all everything. I want to give you all a monthly allowance larger than you make from your streaming, and go out on trips with all of you all the time. But still let you all be free to do whatever you want within reason.

In real life, whenever I go outside, I imagine you and the rest of my harem with me. To go stargazing, camping by the bonfire, riding rollercoasters, playing in the snow, swimming in the beach, a picnic by the grass and the trees, and playing video games.

But even though I fantasize of a harem, you’re special to me. I would love you more than the other girls, even though I won’t tell them this. Only you.

I want every second and every moment of my life from the moment I wake up to when I go to bed to be pleasure and happiness and gentle joy. Not pain, frustration, confusion, and inner turmoil.

I’m such a jerk, you’re in a relationship already and it’s wrong to even say all this, and I even know this, but the heart wants what the heart wants.

I have another dark desire:

Often I catch myself fantasizing how to sabotage your relationship with John. Even though I catch this thought, I only stop it sometimes. Often I let it continue. I would befriend you both, live at the same house as you, play video games with both of you, gain your trust, study your strengths and weaknesses, who is in control of the relationship, your most common arguments with each other, and plan accordingly. I fantasize hiring three hot women to seduce John and make him cheat on you, and when you cry, I console you. You officially break up with each other, and you love me harder than you’ve ever loved any of your exes in the past.

Another fantasy is I create an online account posing as a woman and play video games with John, make him cheat on you with this digital persona, when it’s actually me. I want to strain your relationship.

In real life, I would laugh and giggle when I imagine this. I’m a strong serious Christian yet I think of evil things like this.

One night as I’m stargazing I had a thought: that I should hate that I ever found you. The suffering is so intense. Like my heart (or as terrifying as it is to say it, maybe even my soul) is burning. I desire you but cannot have you. Not only that but I have to deal with disciplining and depriving myself everyday from the joy of thinking of you or looking at you. Am I already getting a taste of hell in this life? My mind is strained. My heart is hurt. I have trouble breathing. Everything hurts. I cannot focus on my responsibilities.

Why do I have to torture myself with living righteously? Why don’t I just give in and actually try to execute these malicious plans? Even if I were to fail (which I know is the most likely outcome), I would be ecstatic and happy, knowing that I at least tried to win your love. I can be at peace then, smiling.

Even though it’s going to be a lot of work, I’d be happy to suffer that way, because you are the reward.

I want us all to live a thousand years together, including the other girls in the harem, and stay together without children until we die. To love and hug and kiss each other all the time.

I want to make occasional requests to each girl, like singing a love song for me and me alone. 

The ranks and titles I would give you all in order are:

Great Empress, Empress, Great Queen, Queen, Great Princess, Princess, Great Duchess, Duchess, Great Lady, Lady

My title would be Master.

What’s the point of this post? I have to share the content of my heart. I have to express my feelings somehow. Hopefully I can have some relief from the hurt.

To everyone who will read, please, before you judge me, realize that I sincerely did try my very bestest and hardest to stop these evil thoughts. But they keep coming back. Put yourself in my shoes, even with all the words I used you can’t know this pain of wanting someone or something and not have it. It’s easy to say “just accept it”, “just move on”, “stop watching her”, or “get a therapist”, when it’s not you experiencing these things.

I accept and appreciate any sincere help. Thanks.",0.07212844,0.026058068,0.004125261,0

Recently I reflect on my life and I don't know but it's that every time I was happy I always had, I don't know, a voice or an impression that I was a burden that I was worth nothing that I deserve to be alone and to die and this even when I was alone or with people I liked and those all the time.
And because of that I feel like I don't know what I feel or what I should feel even when I was in love and always have been. Which ruined a lot of my relationships
I feel like I've almost never been honest  
About what I felt
When I look at myself, being able to bear myself 
I'm lost and I don't know what to do in the ice anymore. I've always felt disgust or hatred because of these impressions. 
I'm afraid

I’m just overwhelmed. I feel stuck. I work in a job I don’t like, with people who don’t like me. It pays more than most places and the benefits are good, and I literally cannot afford to leave. I’m not really qualified for much else. I struggle with making real friendships, I just have no idea how to do it. I’m trying and maybe kind of succeeding but I feel like I’ll just drive them away anyways either by being too annoying or too distant in an effort to not be annoying. The world is overwhelming right now, but selfishly I’m overwhelmed by my own small world and small world problems. 

At the same time, I know I have things to live for. I have a wife who loves me, some people who care about me, I do nice things for myself and others. I feel like a whiney little crybaby because I’m even complaining when SO many people have it worse. Like grow up, honestly. 

Still I can’t help feeling like just not existing would be so much easier. I feel so ill-equipped for life. I’m such a crybaby and I’m so bad at everything I do, but I try really hard and it’s still not enough. Here I am whining again. I really wonder what I’m even worth in the big picture of things. 

And here I am selfish again, even contemplating suicide knowing what that would do to my family and those unfortunate enough to care about me. I feel so guilty feeling this way. But I feel so guilty being alive and being in everyone’s way. I always have a plan, in the back of my head, on how I would do it and it makes me feel guilty and comforted at the same time. 

Life is so hard. And I’m so stupid for saying that, coming from me. Maybe I’m just too soft and stupid. I have to change and I don’t know how. I have to stay alive and I don’t want to. I wish I wasn’t me, I wish I was someone even just a little bit better.",0.32182294,0.06826523,0.053854458,0

I posted here about a month ago about sh and a few people reached out to me because of that post. I talked to some of them but one girl stuck out to me. She knew that I had thoughts of suicide and that I was self harming, and she didn't judge me. She told me she has suicidal ideation too and that she wouldn't stop me if I decided to kill myself, she just didn't want me to be alone.

After that we talked a lot. I never felt like I could trust anyone ever but she somehow got me to open up at least a bit. It was kind of scary, even when I lashed out at her she didn't give up on me. This went on for only a few weeks but whenever I talked to her I felt safe and heard. I hope she did too.

Her parents decided to move to the US. Idk why, I don't think she knew either. As you probably know for immigrants the situation in the US is not the best. The last time I talked to her her parents were getting detained and she was alone. I tried to offer support in any way I could. Today I woke up and saw that her account was deleted. She might've killed herself for all I know. Or she's getting detained right now. I don't have any other way of contacting her. I hope she isn't dead but I'll never know, if she's not dead I hope she lives to see better days but if she is dead I'll try to live for her because that's the most I can do.",0.25462922,0.06739554,0.056582913,0

I don’t even know how to feel right now. Everything at home has been tense since my mom found out my brother got his girlfriend pregnant.

But my mom won’t even listen. She said he needs to “face the consequences” and move out as soon as possible.

I get that she’s disappointed, but it breaks my heart seeing her treat him like a burden instead of her son. He looks so lost, like he’s carrying the weight of the world alone. I keep trying to calm her down, to remind her that he’s still her child, but she’s just too angry right now. I don’t know what to do.

194809689,reddit,offmychest,1762662460,"Living in absolute CHAOS over SIL’s issues

So my partner (24M) and I (25F) have been together for about 2 years now. In that time, I indirectly moved into his mom’s house since she doesn’t actually reside in the home. It was never really an issue with anyone because I kept to myself, cleaned the house without being told, and would even cook for us and my partner’s sister (26F). I never asked her for a dime for groceries nor did I ever expect her to expect me to pick up after her.

I lost a job earlier in the year and after talking to her, she apologized for letting me do her dishes and chores for so long. I took this as accountability and stopped doing her chores thinking she wanted the responsibility back. Wrong! As soon as I stopped, my partner got asked to no longer keep me in the home if he was not present; a new rule set by his mom. I knew instantly, it was my SIL who called and complained because MIL never had an issue with me. On top of this, MIL imposed a “limit the PDA in front of your sister” rule because SIL is insecure about her lack of a partner. 

Whatever, we accept these rules and move on with our lives. Slowly but surely putting money away towards an apartment for us to live in. Well, SIL still doesn’t clean up after herself, still expects a plate when we make dinner, hates seeing us together, and now imposed us to pay 2/3rds of the utilities stating we use it the most. Funny thing is my partner and I shower together most of the time, we do our laundry during non-peak hours, and we limit electricity usage. SIL likes to leave every light on in the house even when she’s not in the room, likes to run the dishwasher, and runs her laundry on permanent press cycles only. 

We recently got into a debate over this because MIL seems to forget that my partner and I are the sole reason her house isn’t falling apart. Apparently SIL wants to move out (with no real plan) and now MIL is telling my partner that we’re going to be in charge of caring for their dog and paying about $3,000 in utilities so MIL can pay her mortgage and stay at her job upstate. On top of that, he asked MIL if she’d keep the same rules on my presence at the household to which she said yes. So yes folks, I don’t get a key to the house nor can I send my mail there BUT I must help care for the dog and pay money into a home I can’t even call home. Absurd, I know. My partner then told MIL that we already toured apartments and have a date set for us to move out; MIL freaked and started asking him about finances and pulled the “who’s gonna watch the dog and the house” card on him. So now we’re dealing with the entire aftermath of that downwards spiral. 

It’s just ridiculous and it’s getting to a point where my partner is genuinely losing his relationship with his mother because she deems me the problem instead of admitting that her daughter doesn’t want me around because I remind her of everything she isn’t. It’s overwhelming and it’s hard to not be petty given the situation but it’s so overbearing to not have any fridge space, freezer space, physical space, nor any rights. Our money is going into a bottomless pit but we’re the only ones who get punished for speaking up.",0.083999306,0.03335018,0.00673361,0

So my best friend of 23 years and I went out for drinks and dancing like we do every weekend. Completely normal night for us. Bar closes and we make for the car so she can drop me off at home. We park outside my place and as usual we sit and pass a cart and vape while having our girl talk, again a normal night out. She has to potty so we go inside so she can take care of business before her drive home. So she comes out of the loo and comes beside me to pet my cat (not innuendo btw) we haven't seen each other in a couple of weeks so we embrace and swing each other around and whisper a conversation in each other's ears for like 10 or so minutes just me telling her I missed her so f$@@!ing much and her returning the sentiment and we just swayed back and forth in each other's arms just enjoying each other's company. This again is normal for us, we're close and we could go a whole night with our arms locked and stuff. Anyway, we separate from our embrace and my gaze caught hers and i saw her eyes move to my lips and without thinking I just reflexively followed suit and well...we kissed. It wasn't she kissed me I guess because we went in at the same time. This is the part that is unusual, never had we kissed before we parted. I pulled away after just a second and asked ""why did we do that?"" (I know my expression signaled shock and confusion). She said it's OK we're gal pals and it's just saying good night. Was that platonic? We have never kissed each other goodbye on the lips before and again I've known her for like 2 thirds of my life. On the cheek, forehead, hands absolutely thousands of times but this was new. It's such a gray area for me because we are soooo close and it really could be platonic and maybe she was feeling really affectionate but I now wonder if I didn't recoil back would it have lasted more than a moment or for several, maybe longer? I'm going go be honest I didn't want to pull away, I had to. Was it innocent? Should I just chalk it up to uv blue lemonade? Or could it be more than that? Should we talk about it?

""what's worse: to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?""

Even after twelve years, I still can't answer this question. Over time, it only got more complicated.
-Shutter island.

I believe that realizing and living as a monster would kill you a thousand times. It really hurts when your mind, soul, and heart get infected and start rotting within you. It's hard to live with all of this, while nothing in the whole world can heal what you've been through.

It always makes me wonder how a person can go far beyond his instinct and choose to be a good man(Die). Awareness always surprises me how it can make the impossible possible.

Actually, Andrew passed that cursed question on to us, because he had already chosen to die as a good man.

Im not panicking or something.
I just feel there's no way out and it's right thing to do.
I didn't get my chance to heal from all i went through.
And I can't accept to see myself falling apart.
My mind full of fears and I can't wait till i see myself homeless or something.
I hate most of people 
And nobody gave a fuck about anyone's life.
These people here who corrupted and ruined my life and i don't wanna reach this point where they gonna have full stare with pity or something.
I just wanna die as a good man.
I used to believe that's I'm kinda a good soul and it's hard to see that soul get drowning in dirt.

119944818,reddit,offmychest,1762122912,"I was 14 when I convinced my dad to go to the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, the next morning,  I watched him die on TV.

My mother Spencer, left my father in 1968 when I was only a few days old. The final straw was when he came home one night especially drunk. My father, Nick, was a full-blown alcoholic by this point, but this night was different; he became physical. My father took me from my mother and forcefully threw her out of the house.

She was 2 weeks out of the hospital from my birth and still had stitches in her stomach. My father and I were locked inside alone, and all my mother could do was watch us through the windows. He stumbled about the house with me in his arms, eventually passing out. My mother was able to get back into the house. She grabbed me, and a couple changes of clothing and left my father. My parents were divorced shortly after, and I’d only see my father a few times in the next 8 years.

In 1976 when I was 8 years old, my dad wrote me a letter. He wanted to re-connect with me. He was living in Arizona where he owned an insurance company. Not long after receiving his letter, my dad let me know he was driving to Albuquerque to see me. I’ll never forget the day. I stood out at the corner down the street from our house at the southwest corner of Los Alamos and Laguna, so I could see him coming.

He was supposed to arrive at 2:00 pm. I remember vividly looking into every car that passed by for my dad. At 8:00 pm, well after dark, my grandmother Marion “Bama” Cornish walked down the street, put her arm around me, and held me tight as she walked me home; not a word was said.

I fell asleep that night crying with my pillow over my head, so nobody could hear me. I still can’t forget the feeling of being worthless, my own father had forgotten about me. He never did show that spring, and I didn’t see him for a very along time after that.

My dad’s life was intense. He was born to William Anton Rank and Mary Collaer. William’s father, my great-grandfather, was partners with and a cousin of Conrad Hilton, of Hilton Hotels. He was partners with Conrad in the startup of the Hilton Hotel chain.

My grandfather William was killed in a mugging in El Paso, Texas when my father was a child. As a result of my grandfathers’ murder, which went unsolved, my father inherited my grandfathers’ hotel fortune at an early age. My father enjoyed his inherited money and lived the life of a jet setter. However, this fortune was probably one of the worst things that could have happened to him.

He was drawn to Hollywood, where he produced music and television. None of it was very successful, other than one song that made the charts. In all reality, my dad was just another young, good looking rich kid, who eventually was chewed up and spit out by Tinseltown. He wasn’t cut out for swimming with the sharks. He left for Arizona to rebuild his life.

I eventually reconnected with my father after he’d move to Colorado and began going to spend time with him twice a year. This was absolutely an amazing time for me. My life in New Mexico was wonderful, but also chaotic and confusing; I had bounced from home to home, until I settled at my grandparents.

But twice a year, I was with my “dad”, he was great and we had a ton of fun; he could do no wrong in my eyes. I was never with him long enough to see his character defects, his human side. I just saw the man who was always excited to see me, was new and exhilarating, and lived a life that I desperately wanted to be a part of.

When I was thirteen, my grandparents let me know that my dad was moving back to New Mexico. They told me that he’d checked himself into a treatment center and when he got out, he’d permanently live in Albuquerque. I was ecstatic. I spent the next month fantasizing about how good my life was going to be with my dad home. My dad lived up to absolutely every expectation I had for him. His first-year home was an amazing, and to this day, it was the best 12 months of my life.

My father had remarried for the 4^(th) time, and his new wife “PJ”, was an extremely cool and beautiful woman. We had so much fun together. She had a great sense of humor, which made her a perfect stepmother for me.

My dad was working part time at a law firm, and part time as a disk jockey at a local FM country radio station. I used to love to go down to the station with my dad and just watch him work. He had a wonderful deep voice and always said cool stuff. One night, I went down to the station with my stepmother to hang out with dad. He was pretty busy on air, so PJ and I started exploring the radio station.

We found another broadcast booth and started pretending to be disk jockeys. We were singing into the microphone and saying the silliest things. PJ really got into it and was acting like a complete clown. Partway through her silly skit, I decided to play a joke on her. I gave her an incredibly shocked look. She stopped her routine and asked what was wrong. I mouthed, “the microphone is on, you’re broadcasting, over my dad!” Well PJ absolutely fell for it and freaked out.

PJ went tearing down the hallway to my father’s broadcast booth. He was on the air, live as PJ slid into the room. She was mouthing, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry” over and over. My dad, headsets on, cigarette in his hand, microphone to his lips, talking to 100,000 people over the airways, gave PJ the funniest look I’d ever seen. I was behind PJ in the hallway bent over laughing, snot coming out of my nose. My dad shifted his confused look from PJ to me. The look on his face went from confusion to a wonderful grin and obvious understanding of the situation.

Dad signed off by saying “This is Nick Brainard at KRST; I’ll see you all tomorrow night.” He flipped the switch in the microphone, spun around in his seat and started to laugh. A deep beautiful laugh.

PJ was still trying to explain that she’d drowned out his broadcast with the silly skit in the next room. She was convinced that she’d been talking and singing to all the listeners out there in Albuquerque, and she was mortified. My dad of course knew this wasn’t true, and that I’d played one hell of a trick on PJ. His laugh went from his chest to his belly, a deep cheerful laugh. PJ was a great sport about my joke, but I did have to watch my back for weeks after. She never did get me back.

Although my father and PJ were not drinking anymore, they smoked lots of marijuana. My great grandmother who we called “Granny”, was the president of the New Mexico African Violet Society. She had a huge green room at my her house that was filled with flowers. Granny would help my dad grow his pot. The two of them would start the plants in her greenhouse under the grow lights. Then, they’d transplant the marijuana into the back yard amongst the various garden bushes and trees. I was fourteen, it was 1982 and I loved to swipe off my dad’s pot plants and get stoned. I’m sure he knew but never said anything.

By the fall of 1982, I was starting my freshman year in high school and my dad’s new wife was pregnant. It was a happy time. For the first time in my life, I felt completely secure. It was also time for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. This event draws up to 500 + hot air balloons; it’s amazing. Since PJ was new to Albuquerque, and had never seen it, my dad decided we needed to take her the next morning.

That evening, I got a call from a really cute girl I’d met at the beach in La Jolla, California earlier in the summer. Her name was Erin, she had blonde hair, and I had a huge crush on her. Erin was in Albuquerque for a couple of days and wanted to go to a movie with me the next day. Of course, there was no way that I was going to the balloon fiesta now! I was an Albuquerque native and had already seen it. But a blond cute girl asking me out on a date, well that just doesn’t happen every day, and my hormones weren’t going allow me to pass up this opportunity!

As my dad and PJ got ready to go home for the night, I told them that I couldn’t go to the fiesta the next day. My dad told me that was fine and they’d decided to go up to the top of the mountains to watch it from there. The Sandia Mountains tower over Albuquerque. There is a spot at the top where you can look down at the entire city. I was surprised that my father wanted to take PJ up there, for her first Balloon Fiesta experience. It was a long drive and would be nothing like being at the launch site.

I was adamant that they not go to the mountains. I told him that PJ would have a much better time, walking through the balloons as they inflated and launched. It is a breathtaking event to be a part of. I persisted until my dad finally relented and promised to take PJ to the fiesta instead of the mountains.

The next morning, I awoke early; I was excited to go on my date. Granny and I where the only ones in the house. Both my grandparents and parents had decided to go to the balloon fiesta. Granny and I were talking about my date with the cute blond from the beach, while we ate breakfast. She wanted to know all about the girl and what we were going to do. Of course, as my words told her about going to a movie, but my hormones were imagining kissing!

The television was on; live scenes of the balloon fiesta were coming in over the airwaves. As we were talking, a “breaking news” broadcast came blaring out of the television. The reporter announced that there had been a balloon crash, and the following scenes were not suitable for children.

The screen jumped to a very large balloon whose’ gondola was filled with passengers. As the balloon did a hard landing, we could see somebody jump, out as if something was wrong. Flames appeared and the balloon shot back into the air. Several more people jumped out, the quick drop in weight caused the balloon to ascend rapidly. By this point, both the gondola and balloon were on fire.

As the balloon reached a substantial altitude, there were a series of explosions, and a lot of fire rolling in every direction. I sat there with Granny, our attention fixated on what we were watching. Another large explosion, followed by two people falling from the balloon. These people were holding onto each other as they fell to their death. Smoke following their bodies as they plummeted to the earth. The impact was brutal, and there was no doubt that they could not have survived that fall.

It was a terrible scene; we’d just watched 2 people fall to a gruesome death, and there was no doubt that other passengers had died as well. People were scurrying all over the place trying to help. The camera would occasionally focus back in on the balloon, which was engulfed in flames and disappearing over the horizon. Until my dying day, I’ll never forget Granny, without taking her eyes off the TV screen saying, “I sure do feel sorry for the families of those people.”

A short time later, a neighborhood friend came over to hang out with me. We went out into the back yard, talked about the balloon wreck that he’d also watched on TV, and started throwing the football. Partway through passing the ball, my friend glanced into the house. From the back yard, you could see the street in front of the house, through a large window. His jaw dropped wide open, he turned back to me and said, that a police are here. I froze; I knew that they were there because of my dad’s marijuana plants. Before I could say a word, my friend ran and jumped over the back wall. I ran through the house and got to the front door, just as the policeman knocked.

When I opened the door, there was a policeman in a suit and two uniformed officers. I thought I could see my father and PJ standing out in the street, their backs to me. The police came in and to my surprise, didn’t say a thing about the pot plants. They told Granny and me that there had been a terrible wreck involving Mr. and Mrs. Brainard. The policeman didn’t say that they were dead; he just said, “terrible wreck.” Granny, being the wise old soul she was, looked the officer in the eye and said, “are they dead.” There was a long pause while the policeman stared at me. He then looked back to Granny and whispered “yes.”

Granny sat there with her hands over her face, crying. The policeman gently rubbed her back and tried his best to comfort her. I was still standing there stunned, my grandparents had been killed. I’d never experienced anything like this before. I had no way to process what had just happened. I stood there frozen, trying to make sense of it all. How did it happen, where was the car wreck, why did it happen?

After a few moments, I looked outside towards where I thought my dad and PJ were. I needed my dad right now; I needed to hold him. I ran past the police officer and out the front door towards them. Just as I ran out the front door, another car pulled up into the driveway. As I ran, I looked over to see my grandparents pulling up. They were alive. I stopped cold in my tracks. I could see the wide-eyed look on their faces, as they took in the scene taking place in the front yard of their house.

I was shocked, I’d just been told that they were in a wreck and were dead. I was trying to comprehend what was happening, did the police have the wrong family?

I turned my head back towards my dad and PJ. They were no longer looking away from the house, they were looking towards me, and they were not my dad and PJ, they were two more police officers dressed in civilian clothes.

In an instant, my world came crashing down around me. Everything went into slow motion. I couldn’t stand; my legs didn’t work. I fell to the ground. I watched the young police officer run across the yard to intercept my grandparents. I could see my grandmother’s face grimaced with agony as she was told that her oldest son was dead, the officer had to help her sit down; she too couldn’t stand. Then my grandfather, the toughest man I’d known in my life, started sobbing like a child. His upper body draped over the hood of the car, hands over his head, moaning. It was an absolutely horrible scene.

I clearly understood now that there was no car wreck, this had nothing to do with a car. My dad and PJ, were the two people we’d watched being blown out of the balloon, falling to their death, together. I’d just watched my father pregnant stepmother die a horrible death. I’d watched the whole thing, not knowing it was two people who I dearly loved. Granny had said that she felt sorry for the family of those people, and it turned out that we were those people.

I went into a deep shock, that lasted for a long time. To make matters worse, I got a little lost in the confusion. My father was so popular and loved, not only in the family, but in the community. People were flooding to the house, and everybody was beside themselves with grief. I can remember sitting in the corner, no able to move, not able to cry, not able to do anything, but sit there, stunned.

At one point, my aunt Beth noticed me sitting by myself in the corner. She walked up to me, rubbed my head, and said that she had just the thing to make me feel better. She handed me a joint. This was such a common solution to problems with my family, inebriation.

During this ordeal, the person who really touched my heart, and allowed me to grieve in the days following their deaths, was my uncle Dar. I was sitting in my father’s van. It had just been towed back from the Balloon Fiesta parking lot. I’d been sitting there for a couple hours. It smelled like my dad and PJ, so there was nowhere else on the face of this earth that I wanted to be.

Dar came out to check on me. He opened the door and asked me if there was anything I wanted. I said, “I just want them back.” Dar grabbed onto me, and we both started crying. It was really the first time I’d broken down since their death. I’ll always be grateful to my uncle Dar for that moment. I believe in my heart it’s what I needed to survive.

The next few weeks were a nightmare. All the television stations kept replaying the scene; we didn’t dare turn on the TV. People were coming and going, and there seemed no time to decompress and grieve. Then I watched as people started to come and take my father’s things, right in front of me. I don’t think the thought even crossed their minds, that my father’s and PJ’s belongings should go to their children. It was awful.

Their personal belongings were being carted off, as if we were having a free yard sale. People who had little to do with my father, helped themselves to his belongings. As I write this today, I still have a tough time keeping my resentment in check for these individuals. I wish I still had every item of my fathers. The few that remained, my brother and I have cherished, as if they were the Hope Diamond; they’re irreplaceable to us. I’ve often wondered if anything was given to PJ’s daughter. I’ve been reconnected to her for a few years now, but never had the courage to ask.

During the period that the looting of my father’s belongings took place, and the constant stream of people flowing through the house, I found the perfect coping mechanism: alcohol. My grandparents’ house always had booze here and there, but now it was overflowing. People were bringing liquor by the gallons, and nobody was paying close attention to me.

I would grab my usual cup of 7-UP, add wine to it, put the headsets over my ears to drown out the sounds, and play the Dan Fogelberg greatest hits 8 track. This would take me away from it all, it did the trick. This was the beginning of a long and brutal battle with alcohol and drug addiction for me, but I’ll save that story for another time.

It came time for my father’s funeral, and this too was a terrible experience. There were so many people, and I only knew a few of them. I can remember during the service, I was up near the casket, I looked into the audience, and there were two girls I went to school with: Kerry and Tanya. I was so grateful to see their faces, two friendly faces that I knew, and liked very much. I’ve been forever grateful for their presence.

When they put my father’s body in the ground, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I’d just been with him at the radio station having fun. He’d just let me drive on the road without my license! We’d just sat in his cool green van and listened to music with PJ. This couldn’t be happening. I couldn’t go back to my old life! He couldn’t leave! And that’s when it hit me; I’d talked my father into going to the balloon fiesta instead of the mountains.

The realization that I’d killed them spread throughout my body. All these people watching his body being lowered into the ground, mourning this tragic loss, and it was because of me. I couldn’t look anybody in the eye. I just stood there staring at my father’s casket. I desperately wanted to touch his coffin and say goodbye, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. To this day I still regret not walking over and touching his coffin.

The level of guilt that I carried for the next twenty years was absolutely brutal. No fourteen- year-old should ever have to shoulder this kind of responsibility. It warped my life in the most incomprehensible ways. I feel incredibly fortunate to have survived.",0.14950264,0.07396803,0.009249465,0

I think I want to be depressed, to suffer mentally. These days i feel fine, almost good even, but I don't want to feel like that. I know it sounds stupid. It's to the point where i am consciously doing things to get worse.

For example i'm not going to some of my classes and not studying properly, but it's not because I am too depressed to do it, but rather it's like i want to ""fake"" being depressed ? I don't want to like my current studies either, because I don't want to keep studying that. I'm definitely getting lazy too, i don't think this is depression or something else because I don't feel bad or guilty for my laziness.

I'm even feeling envious when i hear friends saying they used to have depression or anxiety, which is fucked up on so many levels. I feel like I'm disrespectful of people with actual issues.

I think the reason why i feel like this is because of some kind of weird nostalgia. I've felt depressed before, but i never really understood why. And if i recover from that, then it'll be like it never happened in the first place, like it didn't matter. And I absolutely do not want to forget the person I was back then, because although I was having very low lows, the highs were very high too.

I know all of this is stupid and that there's absolutely no reason for someone to want that.",0.32712606,0.1823172,0.020982565,0

Which it was… but i didn’t really wanna hear that while my mind was still fragile. So i ended the call and was just tweaking until i slept.

so I’ve read a lot of things in here about people being anxious for no apparent reason. I’ve found I get so anxious just thinking about the things I need to do that I get so stuck that I can’t do anything. it’s like my mind is a never ending todo list that I can never get on top of. I constantly feel like a failure and guilty for wasting time all the fucking time. I overthink every single little thing and it’s so exhausting to live like this. I recently started therapy and need to bring this up to my therapist but ugh it all feels so hopeless. It’s like there are so many good things in the world but my stupid brain is caught up on all the shit I need to do and why im not grinding 24/7. I really want to have the ability to feel happy and content with who I am and what I’ve done but for some reason I just can’t. im just so tired of life and everything I could be or should be doing. I wish I could just appreciate the damn sunset without feeling guilty for being outside and not doing my homework.

Hey everyone.
Before you ask, yes, I’m in therapy, and yes, I’ve just started anxiety medication. I’m not looking for debate or denial, just honest perspective from people who get it.

I tried to post in other environmental subreddits but it wouldn't let me. 

I know all the good facts. I really do. Things like:

Global emissions have plateaued and are starting to edge down in key regions.

Over 90% of new electricity capacity worldwide is renewable.

Renewables are now the cheapest source of new energy in most of the world.

EV adoption is skyrocketing, and some projections suggest 80% of new car sales could be electric by 2035.

Even oil companies are being forced by investors and markets to decarbonize.

Big tech companies are chasing real net-zero targets, and public pressure is forcing them to.

Carbon capture and removal projects are scaling up fast, with multiple plants now operating and many more being built.

Major reforestation and soil carbon projects are quietly expanding across continents.

Methane leaks are finally being tracked and cut at scale.

Public awareness and policy momentum are miles ahead of where they were even five years ago.


I know all this, and I believe it means things are changing.
But emotionally, I can’t seem to catch up.

I grieve for the coral reefs, the forests, the lives already being lost to extreme weather. I don’t know how to hold the pain of it without drowning in it. I keep thinking, “Sure, maybe we’ll fix things, but I don’t want to live through the growing pains.”

It’s not that I think the world is ending. It’s that I don’t know how to exist in one that’s so visibly struggling.

If you’ve felt this too, how do you live with it? How do you make peace with the grief and still live your life? Is there anything I’ve missed or any other hopeful projections that you hold on to? Cuz it's getting harder to want to live in a world this painful. I can't handle this constant, growing grief for everyone and everything.

216607249,reddit,offmychest,1762833994,"Mi madre me decepcionó al tener una relación con mi mejor amigo… y años después la vida me permitió devolverle la misma moneda:

No sé por dónde empezar. Si estás leyendo esto, quiero que sepas que no hay peor traición que la de la persona que te dio la vida y del amigo en quien más confiabas.  
  
Me llamo Cesar, y esta es la historia de cómo mi madre traicionó mi confianza al involucrarse con mi mejor amigo… y cómo, años después, el karma se encargó de hacer justicia.  
  
Desde pequeño fui un chico tranquilo, el menor de tres hermanos. Tenía una relación muy cercana con mi madre, Fernanda: una mujer fuerte, trabajadora y hermosa. Ella sola nos sacó adelante desde que mi padre falleció en un accidente de motocicleta cuando yo tenía apenas cinco años.  
  
Mi madre siempre fue una mujer atractiva: cabello rubio, cuerpo delgado y una energía que llamaba la atención. Pero para mí, era simplemente mi mamá.  
  
Todo cambió cuando conocí a Alex, quien con el tiempo se convirtió en mi mejor amigo. Nos unían los videojuegos, el básquetbol, el fútbol, las motocicletas y la música.  
  
Recuerdo cuando lo presenté en casa. Fernanda lo miró con esa mezcla de curiosidad y simpatía que no supe interpretar en ese momento. A partir de entonces, comenzó a mostrar un interés especial por él… un interés que, en su momento, confundí con simple amabilidad.  
  
Con el paso de los meses, Alex se volvió casi parte de la familia. Mi madre lo trataba con una calidez que me hacía sentir un poco desplazado, aunque intentaba no darle importancia. Pensaba que simplemente se llevaba bien con él.  
  
Un día, regresé a casa antes de lo previsto. Al subir las escaleras, escuché risas y sonidos que jamás hubiera querido oír. Abrí la puerta de la habitación de mi madre… y allí estaban. Ella y Alex.  
  
Sentí que el mundo se me derrumbaba. No podía respirar. No podía creer que mi madre y mi mejor amigo me estuvieran haciendo eso.  
  
No hice escándalo. Solo regresé a mi cuarto, tomé una mochila, metí mis cosas y algo de dinero en efectivo. Cuando volví a la habitación de mi madre, ellos aún estaban allí. Les dije con voz temblorosa: “Si eres feliz con él, está bien, mamá. Pero no cuentes más conmigo.”  
  
Salí de la casa sin mirar atrás.  
  
Me refugié en casa de mi tío Carlos, el hermano de mi difunto padre. Él me recibió con los brazos abiertos. Me apoyó en todo y me ofreció un techo hasta que pudiera independizarme. Bloqueé a mi madre y a Alex de todas mis redes y números.  
  
Pasaron los años. Supe por mis hermanos que mi madre y Alex siguieron juntos y hasta se casaron. Yo, por mi parte, me dediqué a estudiar ingeniería en informática, conseguí trabajo como desarrollador y me enfoqué en crecer profesionalmente. Gracias a mi esfuerzo, obtuve una beca para continuar mis estudios en España.  
  
Madrid fue el comienzo de una nueva etapa. Trabajé, estudié, y poco a poco sané mis heridas. Pero el destino aún tenía preparado un giro inesperado.  
  
En una conferencia de informática conocí a Mariana, una mujer inteligente, elegante y llena de vida. Al conversar, descubrí algo sorprendente: ella era la mejor amiga de mi madre, aunque hacía años que no se veían. Al principio me desconcertó, pero con el tiempo, su compañía me ayudó a cerrar heridas.  
  
Salimos varias veces. Tenía una energía que me hacía sentir en paz. Con ella, recuperé las ganas de vivir. Una noche, durante una cena, me atreví a contarle todo: lo de mi madre, lo de Alex, lo que sentí. Mariana me escuchó en silencio, y al final me abrazó con ternura. Fue el primer abrazo sincero que sentí en mucho tiempo.  
  
Con el paso de los meses, Mariana y yo nos enamoramos. Formamos una relación sólida basada en confianza y respeto. No era venganza; era amor. Mis hermanos, aunque al principio dudaron, terminaron apoyándome.  
  
Pasaron seis años desde mi llegada a España. Me gradué, fundé mi propia empresa de tecnología y me casé con Mariana. Ella me apoyó en todo y juntos tuvimos un hijo precioso llamado Jeff. Sentía que, por fin, la vida me había recompensado.  
  
Pero el pasado volvió.  
  
Una de las ferias tecnológicas a las que debía asistir se celebraría en Los Ángeles, la ciudad donde crecí. Decidí ir con Mariana y nuestro bebé. Durante el evento, entre los asistentes, reconocí rostros familiares: mi madre y Alex. Con ellos, una niña pequeña.  
  
Fernanda estaba irreconocible: envejecida, con la mirada cansada. Alex también lucía derrotado.  
  
Cuando se me acercaron, ella murmuró con voz temblorosa: “¿Cesar… hijo, eres tú?” No respondí. En ese momento, Mariana se acercó con Jeff en brazos.  
  
—Amor, aquí estás —dijo con una sonrisa, mientras me abrazaba frente a mi madre.  
  
Fernanda se quedó helada. —¿Mariana? ¿Tú y Cesar? —preguntó sin poder creerlo.  
  
—Así es —le respondí—. Mariana es mi esposa… y este es nuestro hijo.  
  
Alex bajó la mirada. Mi madre no pudo pronunciar palabra. Mariana solo sonrió con serenidad, esa sonrisa de quien sabe que la vida hace justicia por sí sola.  
  
No fue venganza. Fue justicia poética.  
  
La vida se encargó de poner a cada quien en su lugar.  
  
Hoy no guardo rencor. Espero poder perdonar a mi madre algún día, reconocer sus errores y aceptar que, aunque nos separó la traición, también fue quien me enseñó a ser fuerte.  
  
Ahora tengo mi propia familia, y cuando los miro, entiendo que a veces el dolor más grande es el que nos moldea para convertirnos en mejores personas.  
  
¿Ustedes qué harían en mi lugar? ¿Perdonarían? Sus consejos son bienvenidos.

**Perspectiva De Fernanda.**

*No puedo describir lo que sentí cuando lo vi. Aquel joven que estaba frente a mí no era el mismo muchacho al que lastimé años atrás. Era un hombre hecho y derecho, exitoso, sereno… y con la mirada de alguien que ya no me guarda rencor, sino distancia.*

*Mi voz tembló al pronunciar su nombre: “¿Cesar… hijo, eres tú?”*

*Y cuando ella se acercó —Mariana, mi mejor amiga, la hermana que la vida me dio y que perdí por mis propias decisiones— sentí cómo se me apagaba el alma. Llevaba en brazos a un bebé hermoso, de ojos brillantes y sonrisa dulce. Cuando escuché a mi hijo decir que eran su esposa y su hijo… fue como si el tiempo se detuviera.*

*El corazón me dolía. No por celos, ni por sorpresa… sino porque entendí, en un solo instante, todo el dolor que le causé.*

*Ahora era yo quien veía cómo la persona que más amaba formaba su felicidad lejos de mí. Él tenía lo que yo le arrebaté años atrás: una familia verdadera, una mujer que lo amaba, un hogar que no dependía de nadie más.*

*En ese momento, comprendí cómo se había sentido cuando me vio con Alex. Entendí su rabia, su decepción y su silencio. No hacía falta que dijera nada: su mirada lo decía todo.*

*Vi a Alex junto a mí, cabizbajo, con el peso de la culpa en los ojos. También vi a nuestra hija —la niña inocente que no tiene culpa de mis errores— aferrada a su mano. Pero mi propio hijo, Cesar, apenas la miró. Su atención estaba en Mariana y en su pequeño. Y lo entendí.*

*Él ya había elegido su vida. Una vida sin mí.*

*Por dentro, sentí una mezcla de tristeza y alivio. Tristeza porque perdí a mi hijo, y alivio porque al menos lo vi feliz, completo, amado. Tal vez el destino quiso que Mariana apareciera en su camino no para herirme… sino para mostrarme lo que destruí por no saber valorar el amor verdadero.*

*Ahora sé que el karma existe, y no como castigo, sino como una lección silenciosa. Lo que un día hice, la vida me lo mostró desde el otro lado. Y no lo digo con rencor, sino con aceptación.*

*Si pudiera retroceder el tiempo, abrazaría a ese joven de corazón roto y le diría que lo siento.*

*Que nunca quise quitarle la paz, que solo fui una mujer confundida tratando de llenar un vacío.*

*Y aunque tal vez ya sea tarde, solo espero que algún día mi hijo pueda perdonarme, aunque sea en silencio. Porque su perdón sería el único consuelo que me queda antes de partir de este mundo.*

**Actualización Final:**

Han pasado varios años desde aquel encuentro en Los Ángeles. 

Desde entonces, muchas cosas cambiaron en mi vida… y también dentro de mí.

Durante mucho tiempo pensé que el silencio era la mejor forma de sanar, pero entendí que el verdadero cierre no llega cuando olvidas, sino cuando te atreves a enfrentar el pasado sin rencor.

Hace unos meses recibí una carta de mi madre, Fernanda. 

No buscaba excusas ni justificaciones; solo quería verme.

Decía que necesitaba hablar conmigo antes de que fuera demasiado tarde, mirarme a los ojos y pedirme perdón. 

No sabía qué hacer. Pero Mariana me miró con esa calma suya y me dijo:

—Ve, César. A veces el perdón no es para los demás… sino para uno mismo.

Tenía razón. Así que tomamos un vuelo de regreso a California.

Cuando llegué, mi madre me esperaba en el jardín de la casa donde crecí. 

Se veía más frágil, con el rostro marcado por el paso del tiempo, pero había una paz en su mirada que no recordaba haber visto antes.

A su lado estaba Alex, el hombre que alguna vez fue mi mejor amigo y después mi mayor herida.

Y frente a ellos, una niña ya mayor —mi hermana— jugaba entre las flores, riendo sin entender todo lo que ese reencuentro significaba.

Nos miramos por unos segundos que parecieron eternos.

Luego di un paso al frente y simplemente dije:

—Hola, mamá.

Ella me abrazó con fuerza.

Y en ese abrazo, sentí cómo se disolvían años de rabia y resentimiento. 

No hubo discursos ni explicaciones, solo lágrimas.

A veces el perdón no necesita palabras; solo presencia.

Más tarde, Mariana llegó con nuestro hijo Jeff. 

Al verla, mi madre se emocionó y la abrazó con un cariño sincero.

—Gracias por cuidar de mi hijo cuando yo no supe hacerlo —le dijo.

Mariana sonrió y respondió:

—Gracias por traerlo al mundo.

Alex se acercó después.

Lo miré a los ojos, y por primera vez en muchos años, no vi culpa ni arrogancia.

Solo sinceridad.

—César… de verdad, lo siento.

Yo asentí. 

No necesitaba escuchar más. En ese momento comprendí que el perdón era más para mí que para ellos.

Pasamos la tarde conversando, riendo un poco y recordando lo que alguna vez fuimos.  
Vi a mi madre y a Alex tomados de la mano.

A pesar de los años y de que ya no pueden tener más hijos, se notaba que habían encontrado una especie de felicidad tranquila, una paz que llega cuando aprendes a vivir con tus errores y seguir adelante.

Y fue ahí, en medio de esa calma, cuando Mariana me tomó de la mano y me susurró algo que me dejó sin palabras:

—Amor… tengo que decirte algo. Estoy embarazada.

Me quedé inmóvil unos segundos.

—¿De verdad?

Ella asintió, con los ojos llenos de lágrimas.

—Cuatro meses. Es una niña.

Miré a mi madre, que también lloraba, y en ese instante entendí que la vida había cerrado su propio círculo: una historia que comenzó con dolor y terminó con una nueva oportunidad de amor y familia.

Nos quedamos todos allí, viendo a los niños jugar y a Mariana acariciar su vientre.

Sentí que mi conciencia, por fin, estaba en paz.

El pasado había dejado de doler.

Acepté a mi hermana como parte de mi familia, y mi madre aceptó a Mariana, a Jeff y a la pequeña que viene en camino.

Ya no había culpas. Solo gratitud.

Cuando me despedí esa noche, mi madre me abrazó y me dijo entre lágrimas:

—Gracias por dejarme volver a ser tu mamá.

Y yo le respondí:

—Gracias por dejarme volver a ser tu hijo.

Hoy, mientras grabo esto, siento que todo terminó donde debía terminar: en el perdón. 

No fue venganza ni justicia poética.

Iv been dealing with back pain for almost a whole year now, the simplest thing like putting on my socks i cant do without being in pain. I do physio every week until recently I was given the all clear and things started to turn around I wasnt sore. Then I had to reach into a bin and everything's now 1000x worse than before I can even walk my dog its to painful. I have no sick leave and I have no annual leave left so if I dont go to work I dont have a roof over my head or food for my dogs.

I just want the pain to go away. I cant sit I cant stand I cant even lay down without being in constant pain.

All the drs do is give me painkillers that do nothing and tell me to do physio. I swear they are just milking my bank account at this rate. And when you go in the dr just looks at me like I'm telling lies like im a junkie out for their next fix, They don't offer solutions they just look at me.

At first I thought it was a coincidence, but then she showed me a picture. It’s my dad.

I haven’t confronted him yet. I canceled our usual weekly dinner because I didn’t trust myself not to react angrily. My mom is very kind and learning this could seriously hurt her, but she also deserves to know.

To give a bit of background, I started having anxiety issues after developing Dp/Dr ( still don't know why it came in the first place) when I was 13. It then took years of panic attacks, medications, until now, 23 I had finally reached a place where I felt like that could never happen again. I thought i had faced all my fears and it would never bother me.

Cut to a month ago. I decided to visit my long distance gf. She lives in the Us and me in Europe. Within the second day, everything came back. I hadn't had dissociation or a panic attack is 8 years and i've travelled a lot in those years, but it just came back in an instant.

It's now been a month, and we've had some good days, pretty memories, fun moments, but's its also been 60% of being absolutely miserable.

She's had to take care of me constantly, I even bursted in tears on her birthday after pushing myself to do all of stuff and trying to hide my anxiety all day.

I feel so bad for her. I'm also really grieving what I imagined this trip to be.

I leave in today and I just have so much guilt, regret, anger. I ruined this trip for myself and her.

i won't see her for months.

I'm exhausted, completely dissociated, lost, scared. I feel like I ruined everything.",0.029917045,0.013250912,0.0046987277,0

Hi there.

I’m a young female and I’ve had this pressure in the front of my head/eyes for around 2 weeks now, the only relief I get it closing my eyes. It’s almost like my eyes are too slow for my brain, I’ve no idea if that makes sense but it’s just so strange. No actual headache just pressure like I need to pop a pin in it lol. I have had a CT brain and bloods done back in may and they were all 100% fine, just want to know if anyone has experienced this and what relief was given. I’m also very fatigued aswell but not sure if it’s because I’m off of work at the moment. 

Thank youuuu

214730141,reddit,depression,1762823023,"Everything's out of control

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm having a hard time coping. I feel terrible.

I've had a hard life, with a lot of trauma. I also have Asperger's (Autism Level 1) and have a hard time with all aspects of a relationship. I never really built those skills, so keeping in contact and even having friends is emotionally draining.

Yet, I want them so bad.

I want the life most people have as a guy in their late 20s. I want to get married, have a career, and just do things.

I am so held back though, I can't even have one bit of normalcy.

My chronic panic attacks of my youth robbed every good experience I could have had. I was constantly punished to by adults that should have been supporting me.

This has left me so set back, and I can't really catch up. I just want an average life.

Right now, I have no job (can't due to personal circumstances), I'm waiting to go back to university to finish my degree, and I'm living with my parents.

I'm having a hard time finding friends because of this. People of my age treat me less than because I'm not where they are in life stage. I don't want to be hurt anymore from not fitting in.

I'm doing nothing all day because I don't want to get treated poorly. I could do a few things, but with the image I'm presenting now to people, I don't want to.

I don't think that these people are bad, and I understand why they treat me like this. It just hurts.

I'm also dealing with a chronic illness which makes it so I can't have any physical activity. I used to be big into sports, but now I can't even do that.

It sucks to be so depressed and frustrated, and not be able to work it off through exercise.

I'm trying to find a new hobby, but I can't find anything that I like. I don't have many options.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I'm drowning in it.",0.17631748,0.04852104,0.030175667,0

Like the title says, I recently caught my manager having an affair with another coworker. This coworker works under her supervision too. After I caught them together she tried calling me and texted me a bunch asking if she could explain herself and then she apologized for being a bad boss. I think she’s afraid I’ll expose them both, she is married with children and there’s a significant age gap between her and the other coworker. 
I don’t have any interest in exposing them or protecting their secret. I just wish I didn’t know and didn’t have to deal with any of the upcoming awkwardness on their part.",0.112436704,0.04090862,0.010507392,0

I used to feel like a functioning member of society now I feel like a ghost. Feel like I need more help than I have been telling myself lately, I'd like to not rely on medicine, but I think at this point in my life it's safe to say that I need it or I will continue down this path of stagnancy. I was recently just prescribed 25mg Sertraline and was wondering what time I should be taking this pill. I am chronically online and have a hard time going to bed at a reasonable time, I'm pretty upset with myself because I was taking it for a week without any problems and then I just stopped. If anyone could give me some pointers on when to take it for the best results the help would be much appreciated.

I have to live with one parent who went with their partner today, no family member reached outor responded, not even ones in the same county. 

None of my friends reached out or responded either, excapt one responded back drunk but I dont think he knew it was me based on how he addressed me.

Look I know I can be toxic and annoying so I take accountability for that factor but it's not even that relevant to why I'm alone, but it definitely doesn't help. Due to growing up with junkies in a drug den bouncing from all across the state while they chased their buzz, I couldnt make friends, I kept getting passed along to the next grade, never had birthdays, only got Christmas gifts from chruch or school but most would get sold for drugs much like our food stamp card. So even as a child I was alone and no one wants anything to do with me due to my other parent to this day.

I can only make short term shallow friends since highschool which was the only time I had friends for a couple years, which ended because we just grew apart. But here I am now still alone, no family, no friends, no wife.

I'm tired of never being enough for anyone, it makes loving myself feel wrong, I truly have no one and I'm trying to fix it, I'm trying to start my own family, I'm trying to refine my social skills but nothing is good enough, and maybe thats just something I cant change about myself.

I hate my life, I hate myself, I hate feeling this way and I'm just tired of it and I'm getting too old to keep trying.

I'll sometimes say to myself (internally) ""you gotta study bro, notebook is right there just grab it and read for a good 2 hours, you had a 4 days free in a row c'mon"". and then just ignore myself entirely and busy myself with anything that isn't more work.

for example, i'm taking a programming course (which i like btw), and guess what, i'm not practicing or anything, even not doing the optional homework.

i have a whopping 3 or 4 subjects i have tests in next week, and i refuse to study, how absolutely amazing.

like, i'm willing to study strategies to clear levels in games, team comps., and tactics against enemies and such, even make whole theories on symbolisms in my favorite media and such, but not fulfill my one obligatory responsibility at least. my one.

and everytime i think of studying, i just grab something and distract myself.

i also have crazy mood swings. one moment i'll be smoking that hopium and hyped up, and seconds later i'm a complete nihilistic bastard. one moment i'm excited, the next everything goes to shit and i grow mad, or sad, etc.

so, i ask, why? and how do i not?

I’m 24(F), and my fiancé and I are expected to get our first house in the next month or so. It will be by far cheaper than our rent we pay now. On top of that, I own a mini and have learned they are SUPER expensive to maintain. This last week was THE worst. I hit a pot hole on my way home from work and it popped my front driver tire.. took the front two tire off and got them in to a tire shop just to find out we will have to take it to a mechanic because the back tires are out of balance and then found out the back two needed replaced as well because one tire was forming a bubble. We immediately went to a dealership and I ended up finding a car I really like and putting down $1k for them to hold it. I’ll be financing it through my bank which is great since they’ll charge 5% while the dealership charges 15%. RIP my life and saving either way. It’s a 2025 coupe, newest car I’ve ever owned and first car I’ll be putting payments to. Fiancé is open to putting the car under his insurance and I’ll just pay the difference so that’s good but I still feel irresponsible with my money. Thankfully we don’t have any kids and don’t plan on it but I feel like I’m going through my mid life crisis already, which makes sense since my bio mom died at 45 due to our bad genetics with a rare heredity prion disease. I’m just trying not to stress out on everything right now. I’ll be able to afford it I hope but jeez this economy is scary.

I always was kinda crazy - I was bullied as a kid and subsequently I have trust issues, with basically everybody. 

As a teenager and young man I was very transgressional and cynical - not really antisocial so much - but yea I was a nihilistic punk. 

I’m 32. I’m not happy. Sometimes I will go into an office building, or a nice restaurant, and I just want to scurry away. It’s hard for me to maintain jobs.

It sucks because people constantly judge me - I know it is somewhat deluded and selfish to think people are constantly judging you, but in my case they are.

My mom seems to think therapy helps me. Maybe it does, idk. I can’t afford therapy

I am so mad right now!! My friend who is a teacher shared to me about his deaf student who got r*ped by a police officer. 

That police officer had a family in another town (C). He was designated to another town (M). He cheated on his legal wife with another woman in town M. When the side chick got pregnant, they can't have s*x. So he targetted on the deaf younger sister (my friend's student) of his side chick! My friend helped his student file a case against the police officer. The child's family were given money to drop the case. At first the elder sisters of his student were on their side, but they were also given money, so they drop being witness. The student is from a poor family that's why they keep taking the bribe. The one left who is pushing the case is my friend. But he too was being bribed and being threatened. He did not take the money but he was scared of being threaten. He left the town. The child was left alone. After my friend left the case ended badly with the police officer just being put on a temporary break for I think about a month. The police officer is back to work again. And their is no news on the deaf student if how she is doing. I fear for her safety.

113979572,reddit,Anxiety,1762040406,"I have been struggling for a while and just don't know what to do

Hello! I have had anxiety for a very very long time, ever since I was a little kid, specifically agoraphobia, dp/dr, panic disorder and what not. I was able to stay afloat by just burying them all down and pretending they didn't exist until about 2 or 3 years ago, I had an extreme breakdown and my agoraphobia went berserk for almost a year. I could barely leave my own bed without having panic attacks and it was extremely difficult.

During that time I met this person who helped me a lot through all of this and they were kinda like my safety net, they knew very well what it is I was going through and was able to teach me to manage it so well. After a while I started to get much better, and I was able to go out and be around people for long periods of time and I felt like I was starting to return to some sort of normality. But about 3 or 4 weeks ago, me and this person had an extreme falling out, it was really messy and we have basically cut contact with eachother, and since then I have absolutely spiraled. I have constant panic attacks daily, I have trouble sleeping, I feel extremely depressed and alone. I still try to go for walks every day but I can barely leave further than a few meters from my house before I feel unsafe and need to go back.

All of this just boils down to me feeling extremely unsafe. I feel like when I have panic attacks, I have no one to rely on if things go sour. I have a ton of amazing people who are always here to support me and help me when I am in need, but I feel so extremely disconnected from all of them. I feel like they don't truly understand what it is I'm going through and I just can't feel any sort of security in them, even tho I rationally know that I can find the help I need in them.

I just feel so alone, despite having people in my life that are willing to help me. I am trying to take things one step at a time and let myself feel my emotions. But I am just so extremely tired of always dealing with panic attacks. I just want to see some light at the end of this tunnel, but I just feel so hopeless. I have gone through this before and I know I will get through it again. But I am just so tired.

Thank you so much for reading this. I have been trying to post and talk about this kind of stuff with people who maybe understand my condition, find some people who know what it's like and maybe find some comfort in it. I really wish you all the best, and I know how awful these things can be. I hope at least someone can find comfort in knowing they are not alone if they are going through something like me &lt;3",0.13561769,0.031697463,0.017264472,0

I (27F) genuinely cant do anything.

I’m old, everyone around me tells me so. My friends, younger than me (2001) tell me i’m creepy for still living with my parents, while they already have their houses, 9-5 steady income and boyfriends. I have no boyfriend, inability of keeping a part time job for more than 6 months (thats how long part time jobs last in my country) and I’m lucky I could buy a car last year.

I studied philology, so I’m a linguist. I can speak English and Spanish, and I’m halfway decent in French. Obviously my English is not the best as I have not left my country and you can imagine how bad my French is.

I hate teaching and I did not pursue the masters needed for teaching, so I cant teach. Instead, I’m finishing a masters on Digital Marketing and International Commerce. I also have worked in aviation as a Ground Handling Operator and Check In Agent.

Thing is, none of the thins I know will get me far. Translating? Taken over AI; that or become freelancer which is not smart.

Can’t teach, I’m too old to get into yet another masters and I need a job already. And I don’t even have the patience to teach anyways.

Marketing? Sure. All openings ask for minimum of 4 years of experience, and I have not even finished my masters…also, I dont even remember half the things I learnt?

And working at an airport…forever condemned to getting paid by the hour, exploited, not having a serious job…

Most folks quickly learn that it&#039;s not worth writing out and explanation, since the medically autistic will refuse it. <br><br>It&#039;s almost to the point where quality analysis does the medically autistic a disservice. Imagine this hypothetical, your brain is wired to only accept ideas you come up with organically. Anything you didn&#039;t come up with yourself is discarded as foreign influence and assault on your sense of &quot;self&quot;. That means every time you read something that&#039;s a good idea said idea is off the table. Even if you would have eventually come up with the idea yourself eventually, now that someone has &quot;spoiled&quot; it for you it can never be something you identify with and put into practice. In this scenario it&#039;s better to just tell the medically autistic that they&#039;re fucked up and need to figure it out on their own.<br><br>Fortunately, I love a little mischief. If quality posting can permanently eliminate good ideas for the medically autistic then I&#039;ve done God&#039;s work. Someone that stubborn doesn&#039;t deserve nice things or good outcomes.

The fact that you&#039;ll take feedback and critically analyze it means you&#039;re probably not medically autistic, but your writing style indicates that you are.

Every time I see someone in denim I lose a bit of faith in humanity. It’s like we gave up. Like we stopped aspiring to elegance and decided looking like a pathetic homeless person is okay. Denim is the aesthetic death of the West.

It’s ugly and awkward and loud. It doesn’t flatter anyone. It doesn’t elevate anything. It reduces every outfit to mediocrity. You could be wearing the most beautiful coat or shoes and the second I see jeans underneath it’s over.

When I met my boyfriend I did a full purge. Threw out every denim item he owned. He looks like a person now. Not a milquetoast dilettante. He even thanked me. He said he didn’t realise how ugly he looked before. Growth.

I genuinely believe denim is part of the wider collapse in standards. No pride. No sense of occasion. Just comfort over dignity and “casual vibes” as an excuse for being an ugly horrid savage.

We used to build the Sagrada Familia. Now we wear bootcut jeans to social gatherings. This is why the West is dying.",0.49139655,0.5101222,0.2774022,0

My greatest wish is that one day, someday, someone will see me for who I am and see me as an exceptional human being. 

I don't have myself, and no one is coming to help me. But I need something because those closest to me don't see me for who I am, my efforts, my motives, the struggles I've been through. The worst. They don't have high regard for me or high expectations of me, and I suppose my younger self is to blame, my childhood, but they bring it now in the present when I am doing my best to do things, but even then, my efforts and my success have not been acknowledged like my mistakes.

I feel so morbid, and I feel like dying because I don't even have myself. I used to doubt what they said, but I am beyond my limit from all the terrible things that have happened that have harmed me and shot down my esteem to an all-time low in the process, and I feel like dying. I feel like going through with my plans and ending it all.

I wanted to be an exceptional person for myself and to others, but people cannot see what I used to see in me. Many people used to regard me as such a sweet, kind girl, with good things to say, but I don't know why recently people have started having the lowest opinions of me when I am trying my best to be good, no matter how bad things hurt.

I went to visit my (28M) parents and girlfriend (29F) for a month, ending last week. They live 20 minutes from each other.

I confided in my mum one night, that I often feel like I'm trapping my girlfriend. For context, I have a neurological condition that causes me unbearable, constant pain. I have made it very clear to my girlfriend exactly what this condition means for my life, and hers, if she stays. I understand logically that she is an adult and capable of making her own informed decisions. The guilt still eats at me though.

My mum asked me what I though I was bringing to my relationship. I said I felt like I wasn't really bringing anything. I just try to be the best version of my self for her, but I know that that is the bare minimum. And that I try to be a good person for her.

What my mum said took me by such surprise that I didn't really process it untill after she left. She told me that I was a bad person, or at least a mean one. But that she didn't think it was my faut, because I ""can't really understand the difference"".

My mother has never brought up anything like this in my life. It completely blindsided me. I haven't ever considered myself to have any cognitive issues like that. And nobody has ever said that I'm a bad person before. It's been going arround in my head. I don't know how to bring it up to my mum, to ask her what she really means.

Both of my parents have always been amazing. I've considered myself lucky in that regard my entire life. So I don't believe she would say something like that out of malice.

113173515,reddit,offmychest,1762068333,"I lost myself trying to be enough for everyone… but I’m learning to live again.

I don’t know where to start. Maybe from the beginning — from a little girl who was born into a family that probably didn’t need her. When I was born, everyone seemed happy at first, but that warmth faded fast. I was mostly raised by my grandmother because my mom was young and had her own struggles.

I grew up watching fights, feeling unseen, and constantly trying to earn love that should’ve been freely given. For me, education became everything — my only way to prove I mattered. I was a excellent student till grade 5,But in 6th grade, I failed to meet expectations for the first time. I scored 11/25 in Math and 13/25 in Hindi. That day, I faced the kind of fear that changes a child. I was beaten and shamed — and I remember crying not because of the marks, but because I felt I wasn’t enough.

From then on, fear became my biggest motivator. I was the “smart” kid who slowly turned into an “average” one. I pushed myself through every grade, terrified of failing again. By the time I reached high school, I was exhausted — emotionally and mentally. I still remember my 10th board results: 92.1%. People said it was good, but to my parents, it wasn’t good enough.

I worked so hard to prove myself — joined a good college, studied day and night, but lost my determination and joy. I was constantly compared to others, reminded of my flaws, and never allowed to just be me. I lost myself, and somewhere along the way, I stopped feeling happy.

Then came the pandemic — lockdowns, isolation, online classes. My 12th didn’t go as planned, my medical entrance didn’t work out, and I felt like a failure. My parents compared me to others again, and I remember thinking, I just want to disappear.

But I didn’t. I got into engineering that too good college, built projects, and tried to find some sense of purpose. I worked hard, sometimes too hard. Still, life had other plans. I faced setbacks — I even failed one subject and couldn’t bring myself to tell anyone. The shame nearly broke me.This time my hair fall problem had started but I couldn’t give attention to it.

Later, I got an internship even with my backlog and then a full-time job. On paper, I was doing fine. But inside, I was drowning. My parents became stricter, and I was juggling work, home responsibilities, and endless expectations. I felt like a robot — waking up, working 10–12 hours, coming home, and doing house chores. No rest. No peace.

Then came another blow — I started losing more hair due to stress and thyroid issues. Watching handfuls of my hair fall out every day shattered me. I lost my confidence, my smile, and my will to look in the mirror. I felt ugly and worthless.

There were days I questioned why I was even alive. I cursed myself for being born. I had no dreams left, no confidence, no reason to keep going.

But somehow, I did.

Because maybe… life isn’t about being perfect. Maybe it’s about surviving through imperfection.

I realized that even if I don’t have much to show, I still have something to give — kindness, love, empathy. I still live because I want to make my mom proud someday. I still live so that I can help my sister chase her dreams. I still live so that some other girl who feels like giving up can see this and know she’s not alone.

Even if I’ve lost everything, I haven’t lost the power to try again.

So here I am — not “healed,” not “successful,” but still here. Still learning. Still choosing to live.

If you’re reading this and feel like life has broken you — please hold on. You don’t have to shine right now. Just survive. That’s enough. One day, you’ll look back and realize surviving was your biggest victory.

Thank you for reading — this is the story of a girl who’s still learning to love herself. ❤️",0.03592727,0.017743196,0.0064006294,0

Hey everyone,
I’m a 19 year old dude, 5'11"", brown skin, decent physique, health-conscious, and a computer science student from a recognized university. I’m into hackathons, building crazy projects, and love innovation. I’m also the kind of person who helps with every household chore, cooks for my loved ones, and proudly calls myself a mama’s boy.

I’d say I’m decently good at studies and love connecting with people yet, I’ve never been in any kind of relationship. Not even once. At this point, I’ve started wondering what’s wrong with me.

Whenever my friends find out that I don’t have a girlfriend, they genuinely don’t believe it they say it’s impossible. But the truth is, I just haven’t found anyone yet. I’m looking for someone loyal, understanding, fair skinned, good looking, and good in studies someone I can trust blindly.

But no matter how much I try, I’m not able to find anyone like that. Am I delusional to think I’m good enough to have a girlfriend or a loyal partner? Or is it just that things take time?

Hi!  I’m a 49/f that lives in Arizona.  Feeling very much alone these days.  It’s been quieter lately, although I can’t decide if the house has changed or if I am changing.  The room seems heavier.  Sometimes I catch myself listening for a sound I can’t name….or, of something that isn’t there anymore. The air feels different too.  I move through the days carefully, just not wanting to disturb whatever silence is left.  Anyway, if anyone else feels alone and maybe wants to make a new friend or connection…feel free to send me a message.  Thanks!",0.038048524,0.015340924,0.00828752,0

I (32F) fell for my colleague (30F) last year. We got close through work, she used to mention me to all her friends, told me she dreamt about me, and before long, we were spending nearly every day together. What started as friendship turned into something deeper. I was her first relationship with a woman, and for a few months, it felt real and mutual.

Then, she ended it over text, on my birthday. She said a same-sex relationship wouldn’t work, that she wasn’t a lesbian. I was heartbroken. But even after the breakup, neither of us really let go. It turned into this painful situationship she wanted closeness and comfort, but not commitment.

Today, after two years, I finally gave her belongings back things she left at my place months ago. When I handed them to her, she started crying. She said she’s scared I’ll cut her off, but also repeated that she “can’t be more than a best friend” to me because she’s not a lesbian. I told her I understood, but inside I was breaking. Because I can’t be just her best friend. I still love her.

I’ve muted her on all social media and I’m trying to move on, but I feel empty. It’s like she gets to live freely and move forward (she has met a new guy) while I’m stuck processing the wreckage. She said she was selfish for keeping me around knowing she cannot give me more. I keep replaying everything how she used to confide in me, depend on me, and how she’s now giving parts of that to someone else.

Right now, I’m trying to accept that she only wanted the parts of me that made her feel safe not the whole of me. And that’s not love.

I know I need to let go completely. I just wish it didn’t hurt this much to lose not only someone I loved, but my best friend too.

I want to move on. I want to be free. But part of me is still waiting for her to miss me the way I miss her.

I don’t know whether to stay friends, create distance, or cut contact completely. I still care deeply about her, but I also know she’ll never choose me.",0.24763705,0.056719027,0.10221587,0

This is going to pretty messy since this is the first time I am writing on reddit.
I’m currently in my senior year of high school, and in my country, getting into a university requires taking a very important national exam that covers all four years of subjects. It’s somewhat similar to Korea’s Suneung exam. (I couldn't find a better way to describe it.) And since I want to get into a medical school, I am preapering for the exam.

The problem is, I struggled with severe depression over the past three years, and unfortunately, I was only able to receive proper treatment quite late due to various reasons. This had a huge impact on my life — I went from being one of the top students to barely passing.
During that time, I couldn’t bring myself to study properly, which led to poor results in almost every exam and a lot of wasted time. I also couldn’t get any extra tutoring or academic help because I had already fallen behind in my studies.

And now, I’m trying to relearn all the subjects I couldn’t learn before, while also keeping up with the new topics. Tbh, it’s all became a huge mess. Since I’m still dealing with depression, I can’t study properly, and the stress just keeps making things worse.
I even had to quit private tutoring because my tutor made me cry by calling me lazy during one of our lessons. In the exams we take at school, I’m ranked at the very bottom. The only real support I have is from my therapist. Even my parents don’t care about my studies or anything related to them. My therapist even admitted that my father doesn’t really care which university I would get into. I don’t have any friends I can truly trust either. So, it's a whole mess.

So, my question is, how can I keep my motivation up in a situation like this? I am even up to just a simple reassurance at this point. 

(Sidenote: I am not a native English speaker so I had to translate some parts, if it's quite messy sorry abt that)",0.059479803,0.019354604,0.011543332,0

My dad is still alive as far as I know but we haven't been in contact in a couple years. My dad was (is?) an addict who always chose drugs and women over his children. Supposedly he got married to a new woman and is off drugs now. After him being on them for 30+ years. I'm glad he is sober now (if he actually is) but the last time I saw him he was bringing Christmas gifts by for my kids. And he was falling asleep sitting up. I just wonder why he chose to stop doing drugs for this woman he has married and not for his children. Well, child. My brother passed in 2005 and it was just us 2. Not sure why I went into all this i guess I am just venting. I really wish I could have a hug from my mom though. I miss her so much. She would just love my babies. I wish she could have met them.

I'm 26 and I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 13. For half of my life I've had this heavy, aching weight inside of my chest. I've been a looming mist in other people's lives, filling the empty air with half-hearted plans and unkept promises. 

I'm in tens of thousands in debt from student loans and no degree to show for it. I've dropped out/taken leaves on and off since finishing my first semester of college, all for mental health reasons: eating disorder, alcoholism. Upon my most recent return (after a 5 year hiatus) I was really determined to finally finish what I started. This year felt like *the one*. I finally left an abusive 4-year relationship, I reassessed my priorities, and I started doing what's best for me. Then, after my first week of classes I was drugged, kidnapped, and raped by my coworker who is twice my age. Boom. Back to square one, again. Now I am out of a job and on another leave from school, waiting for a break in my case because my rapist is nowhere to be found. What the fuck do I do? I can't cope anymore. 

I just can't to do it. I don't want to keep trying, the more I try the more I feel myself digging deeper into a hole of debt and doubt for nothing. I feel like a sham and a waste. I see my older sister with her master's degree and 6-figure job, I see my cousin in his microbiology PhD program, I see all my college friends with their degrees, newer friends with established jobs, and it all hurts that I can't be that. I'm lost. I'm indecisive. I'm incapable. I've job hopped around 8 jobs in the past 5 years, I can't settle and I can't just be content. I never finish what I start. I'm stuck in this rut, the same rut I've been in since before I can even remember. I don't trust myself to pick a path that is right for me anymore. I keep hitting walls instead of finding a door and I want to give up trying so I can at least get used to the disappointment. 

This is my daily spiral. Today, it is especially overwhelming.",0.27525392,0.15627414,0.020882076,0

I don’t know what to do anymore. Im in my mid-30’s but have struggled all my life with depression. I’ve been on medication for over a decade and worked with my psychiatrist to find what works and what doesn’t. It leaves me with a balance where I’m not constantly depressed but lucid enough to be productive. I’ve been in therapy almost as long and have been having luck with my current therapist. I’m married with two young kids, the older of which has autism (probably undiagnosed myself given the similar behaviors we both exhibit). My wife of 10 years has put up with a lot of my bad behaviors and stuck by me through it all (alcoholism, verbal abuse, self harm, etc.) and I’ve gotten a lot better in all these regards but obviously her tolerance for any backsliding is very low. I’ve been under a lot of stress at work and have been struggling financially (over $60K in credit card debt) and that’s not including car and student loan debt. A big part of that was to buy our townhome 4 years ago which I already feel bad about as being too small for my kids to have a good childhood in. I’m also stressed about a new promotion I got which is nice but means I’ll have more work and work travel to do when I already feel like my days are strapped between work/family/chores etc. She’s tried to be supportive but I keep pushing her away and she says I act like I don’t even want to be a part of this family and that I make it seem like our family is making me miserable. It’s not, it’s just that I know my ideal life is an unrealistic fantasy (no money problems, never having to work, all the fun stuff none of the work. like I said, a fantasy that I know is impossible). Now she says she’s going to divorce me and take on the debt so I can stop being so miserable. This just makes me feel awful for putting my family through my bs but I don’t know how to just not be such an asshole. As I stated already, I’ve been doing the work and have gotten better but know there’s always this part of me that is going to do some stupid shit that hurts my family. Ever since having kids, I know I’d never hurt myself as I don’t want to inflict that pain on them, but I don’t know what to do to make me and my family happy.",0.05898502,0.018645585,0.018470341,0

I met this girl on Reddit a while back. It started as a casual, friendly chat, nothing serious, just random conversations we were just doing  casual chats Slowly, we got into a small rhythm. We barely talked over calls( but she talks shares more over a call) but we did connect sometimes.

One day, she sent me a picture covering her face, and damn, it looked nice in dress. I complimented her and teased her a little, just for fun. Our chats were always light and friendly, but somehow, I enjoyed those little talks.

Earlier, she used to reply quite fast, but after she moved to another city, her replies became slower. Still, I remember those days when she was in her hometown — she’d share her cooking pics, small snaps, and random things she made. Honestly, those small things made my day. I don’t know why, but they did.

We never met in person, barely talked on calls, but she used to send me her photos, singing clips, dancing videos… little pieces of her life. Those small moments genuinely made my day. I don’t know why, but I felt happy just seeing her happy.

I never had any big expectations from her. I just liked her presence in my life  even if it was rare and unpredictable. She used to talk generally, casual chats and all but she always kept sending those snaps. It made me feel like I mattered to her in some small way.


Now I’m left confused.
If she didn’t care… why did she make me feel like she did?
Why show me that little closeness if there was never any intention to stay?
What if she already has someone? Why involve me then?

I know she was never mine… but it still hurts to feel replaced without even knowing what went wrong.

Just wanted to get this off my chest.",0.33255672,0.08434689,0.046159767,0

You ever notice how everyone keeps saying “take care of your mental health”, but the moment you slow down, people start calling you lazy?

I see this every single day. People posting about self-care, therapy, and balance, and then bragging about how they slept only 4 hours, worked 10 straight days, and “still showed up.” Like, isn’t that the exact opposite of what mental health actually means?

We’ve turned exhaustion into a badge of honor.
We wear stress like it’s a medal.
And if you try to take a break, society makes you feel guilty, as if resting means you’ve failed.

It’s funny and sad at the same time, we talk about “burnout culture,” yet we secretly admire the ones burning out the fastest. Maybe we’ve confused being busy with being valuable.

I’m not trying to sound preachy. I’ve been there too, overworking, forcing productivity just to feel worthy. But now I’m trying to unlearn that. To slow down. To live without feeling the need to prove something every day.",0.2854937,0.26957804,0.011691323,0

I converted to christianity over a year ago. But I'm still depressed. I've been depressed since I was at least 13 years old (14 years of this now). 

I don't even want to read my bible or pray. I no longer get joy from doing it. I can't concentrate of the sermons on Sunday. Last Sunday, I left early because I couldn't stop crying for no good reason plus I couldn't concentrate on the service. I don't feel like anyone at the church understands what I'm going through or what I've been through. I feel alone and isolated by my experiences from others in the church. I'm sinning in my depression. I don't want to reply to people reaching out to me and praying for me. I don't want to talk to my pastor and get advice on using the psalms to lament to God. Idk if God actually does get what I'm going through, which sounds insane. I don't feel like being Christian when I'm depressed like this.

I posted, and apparently deleted my post about my cata dying. Well one was euthanized last year at 21, and now my 14 yo cat, who turned out to not be ill with FeLV is now on her last weeks of end stage CKD.  

Well, she got out yesterday z and I just lost my shit crying on my phone with my mother, so I had to hang up. I ended up getting email from her saying that she wanted to get out because cats do that when they are dying and she wanted to die out there. She wanted to go starve and go out in the now very cold weather I've what would be several days of suffering outside???

So I reached out to my friend upset about that and I got two lines of support with a paragraph about his own life. Maybe it's just me, but that felt very wrong. I have been really supportive to him. I know he's had loss. But could I maybe just talk about this one thing?

And another thing which is out of the scope of my frustration, but my mother is trying to convince me to immediately get another cat. I'm gutted right now, and the emotional toll is too high. I did just realize that she wants me to get another cat because she knows I don't really care to be alive very much, and don't take care of myself, so maybe this was her solution to help? 

I just have no one that doesn't have their own agenda, and I just need to grieve without feeling like I need to take on someone else's grief.",0.41168427,0.26957804,0.039714564,0

158127668,4chan,r9k,1762410161,"When I was in college, I had a girlfriend whose relationship with sexual desire was essentially to take no pleasure in the sex act, but demand its performance as a ritual. That is to say, she just wanted me to fuck her, and like it, so that she could feel affirmed in some respect. It made me feel so disgusted with myself, like the highest pleasure I was ever supposed to achieve in life was fucking this hole whose owner was giving me the honor. I would perform the sex act like a machine, and if I ever didn&#039;t, I must not be attracted to her anymore, or that I must be gay. When we first started going out, the sex was good, and we both enjoyed it. After a while, she wasn&#039;t able to cum during sex anymore, and I asked her if there was anything I could do, but nothing quite worked out. That&#039;s fine, sex can be enjoyable without orgasm. But as time continued, I could sense her level of activity and participation dwindle down, until I found myself in the position described above. For a month or so, I went through a period of low libdo, and I couldn&#039;t reach full erection when she would demand I perform the ritual sex act. I could tell she was hurt by this, but what was I supposed to do? On some occassions during that period, I remember managing some 3/4 hard fucks, just forcing myself to do it. I remember the lying, the pretending to enjoy it. Like my body was a broken tool, that could no longer serve its cold, robotic task. I&#039;m not saying all this to be hateful towards her, since it was all so long ago. It&#039;s just a personal tragedy that I feel like I have nowhere else to share, since portraying the male sexuality in this way in polite society feels like it would run me the risk of ostracization.",0.7510937,0.3393024,0.10757765,1

Hello! I’ll try to sum this up briefly, I’ve been having this issue for the past 6 or so months. Some context, I have had severe generalized anxiety since I was pretty young and one of the strange side effects of this is that I constantly hyper ventilate and feel like I’m unable to catch my breath. I’ve gotten this checked out by pulmonologists and they’ve all said it’s purely psychosomatic. This issue has also caused me very bad chest and back pain due to constantly breathing heavily which has worsened in the past year.  I also want to be clear because doctors seem to misunderstand me when I talk about this, but this issue a constant thing and doesn’t only occur during panic attacks. This is also something a large amount of my family members have experienced who also have anxiety, but mine is the most severe from what I gather. There hasn’t been one moment since 11 years old that I haven’t been manually breathing/forcing in air. Starting about 6 months ago I have woken up every morning with stabbing pain in my chest and abdomen that make me feel as if an elephant was sleeping on me all night. I thought for awhile that it may be heart burn but I’ve experienced heart burn before and it’s nothing like it. I do not have the best diet and use strong nicotine pouches but I am a healthy weight for my age , I just wanted to include this because I’m still open to the idea that it may be diet related.

Hi everyone, my name is Simone, I'm writing here to understand if I'm perhaps lazy, or if I have some problem that needs to be solved. 
My guess is that I believe I suffer from depression and anxiety.
Suddenly I woke up and started thinking about what I've done so far (I'm 23) in my life, and I saw nothing...
I've always been late, I only graduated 2 years ago, I've never been in a relationship, never had these experiences that you normally have as teenagers, I've always been sad almost all the time, even when in company with friends, in the evenings, I've always felt a bit of a stranger to everything.
In this last period I've been living with a lot of regrets, of what I could have done/been and it's weighing on me a lot, it's as if I have a void of an unlived life that can never be filled. At the moment I see everything gray and my thoughts are increasingly dark.

I have a lot of difficulty in relating to people, and when I try to do so I feel like I am judged negatively, even by family members.


I'm thinking I need a hand, hoping in some way to be able to find a bit of serenity and carefreeness that I've really been missing for a long time.",0.13908891,0.032909457,0.031722516,0

I have known my best friend for almost a decade now and there is no other person in my life that I can talk and be vulnerable with as much as I am with her. We have the same profession and we live in the same city, and we hang out almost every weekend.

I am the person who has been active in sports all my life. Tennis and swimming sessions have been a part of my routine since I was a teenager and even though I do not get a chance to do it as much as I used to, it has helped me stay in shape. She on the other hand has a more curvy figure. 

Even though I was always aware about her significantly bigger cup size, it was not something that bothered me until I noticed how often I found men around us checking her bust out. Initially I felt the disgust that one would expect when I would find a man doing it but the more it happened, the more I compared myself to her and felt the urge to have the same attention.

We both have been on dating apps, and I have noticed she always has more attention with the pfp as her photo in which she is showing the bust off.

*This could be a little long read.*  
  
21F  
Backstory- It's been about 5 months since I am back to live with my parents after finishing my college, I always wanted to start something of my own rather than getting a job. I was pretty excited for home, but I guess I should've recalled how manipulative and narcissistic my parents are. Almost everybody in my family either hates me or humiliates me for being lazy, obese, average at acads and ""having issues"". Got diagnosed for chronic depression and anxiety, started therapy for about a year and recovered myself. I thought my parents and home would be my safe spot but since I am back, I have started to realize all they want is to control me. I am not allowed to have an individuality or an opinion. I am often manipulated and lied to. This has made me angry, furious, distrustful, restless and really distinct with my parents. I cannot find one moment (even when I am alone) when I see myself loving them. I often cry myself to sleep when I pity the situation I am in. The situation is so bad that I can never speak to them softly anymore. They always see me pissed at minor things, their harmless jokes are enough to make me go above and beyond and yell at them.   
I stopped my therapy a while ago when I was at college, got addicted to weed and cigs. I used them to cope with something in me that used to come up when I was alone. You'd find me sitting in one place for hours, mindlessly staring into the void and often imagining situations where I was gonna die to help me fall asleep. 

Cut to current situation, I've recently started coping w excessive sleep. Since the past 2 months I was sleeping barely 3 hours a day with excess caffeine just to feel some energy. Now I doze off for 15-20 hours without realizing the time. Haven't had a hair-wash in about 3 weeks. Often forget to even get ready for the day. With exams being lined up by the end of this month, I am pushing myself but I can only do very little. I have lost my appetite and looking into the mirror makes me sick. I hate everything about myself. Been having vivid dreams about my loved ones. 

I don't think I live in my body anymore. I can't find me. I could have developed a bipolar-disorder for being furious about the smallest of things. Thinking my bf only wants me for sex and doesn't care about me. It makes me helpless, I wish I was dead in an accident or something. 

I have recently started to see things and talk to an imaginary friend let's call it ""Dave"". It's a genderless person who keeps on blabbering to me and I don't feel safe around it. During situations when my heart is racing it often comes near my ear and says shit. I cannot sit quietly in his presence. The only good thing he does is when I cry, he tries to make me laugh. I am not sure how healthy this is but I can't see a way out of it for now.  
I don't know what to do and how to stop sabotaging my relationships. I don't think nobody understands me, I am usually hyper fixated on music and listen to it for hours (like 8-10) continuously which helps me calm down.  
These days I am highly suicidal, trying to run away from home and never come back. Nothing seems important anymore, no exam, no getting a job, no dream. I feel I have lost myself completely in front of everyone without even them noticing. And I don't know if I could ever recover from this. Feels like I would die like a rodent on the street, tbh that's all I could ask for right now. Being me sucks, I hope nobody goes through shit like this.

My work requires me to provide my own laptop and use Windows 11 and Edge.

It often takes 5 seconds to respond to clicks even with 16 GB RAM. Loading cassettes on a C64 would be an improvement. I just spent an hour installing my home printer driver from the manufacturer site, which I could do in 2 minutes from Control Panel on previous Windows versions. I've had to do 2 factory resets, one because the taskbar disappeared and one because I couldn't get 24H2. Edge refreshes tabs when you return to them with no way to disable it and extensions often stop opening until a restart.

That's about it really. One of my best friend's best friends sexually assaulted me a long time ago. My best friend did such a trash job being there, she went so far as to assume I was lying and she told me to stuff it down. Our other mutual best friend tried to be neutral and — for years — has said nothing. For some fairly straightforward reasons, my mental health has declined precipitously and my life generally sucks.

Both have put distance between us, to the point of being cut out.

In the long run, it might not be the worst thing in the world, although it's pretty devastating to have a 25+ year friendship end because of someone else's cowardice and emotional abuse. It feels like being double victimized. She treated me poorly; my life got weird because I received abuse when I needed a hug and someone to advocate for me; I became someone less easy to be friends with; she left.

I made this account for the purpose of making a post like this. I just don’t know what to do. Very long story short I am a first responder and I think my job causes or at least exacerbates the vast majority of my mental health struggles. I have been doing this job for about 6 years (not a long time, I know) but I feel like it is absolutely destroying me. No matter what I do it seems like I always get something wrong. Every response has some major point that I have a personal issue with and I like many first responders am very critical of myself. I am well aware of this and I know I should “give myself grace” but that mantra doesn’t take away the feelings I have no matter how much I try to believe it. I was recently promoted and many people around me tell me that I am worthy of this promotion and that I do a very good job. I just can see past the outward praise and I know for a fact that I am not what they think I am despite whatever appearance I put on. Every single shift I have horrible anxiety and constantly think about quitting and what life could be like without this job. The problem is that every family member and friend I have think that quitting would be the most absurd idea ever and they refuse to even see it as a possibility. About a year ago I went and got some professional help and was diagnosed with MDD and social anxiety. This came after I decided that the amount of drinking to self medicate that I was doing was a problem and additionally at the time I was having persistent thoughts of self harm. I was in-patient for 38 days and I find myself almost wishing I was back in that environment because I was heard. I also was not working during that time which probably also helped. I just feel so absolutely trapped by this career that I am utterly drained and have difficulty finding any enjoyment in life. I can’t imagine doing this for 20+ more years because I am miserable and I don’t see things turning around when this job constantly beats me down. I feel sick just thinking about it. It seems like there could be so much more to life if I could have even one day that I can say I truly enjoyed. Even my days off are ruined by the mere thought that I have to return to work at some point. I just want out before too much irreparable damage is done.

117709557,reddit,offmychest,1762077471,"i think my ex boyfriend sucked

tw: mentions of sexual assault (i think. i guess. idk.)

this is long, sorry in advance 

i (then 22f, now 25f) met my ex initially (then 27m, now 30m) at a halloween party in 2022 that his sister / my friend was hosting. he (calling him M) had a girlfriend at the time and i didn’t really think beyond any of our interactions. i remember speaking with his then-girlfriend a few times that night about pretty random things but nothing out of the ordinary. there was a point where i remember her playing with my hair a bit and complimenting it (not to toot my own horn but i have very long, fine hair and im used to people often asking me to touch it so i really didnt think anything out of the ordinary) 

my friend/M’s sister (J) said something to me a few days later that the then-girlfriend and M both seemed “into me” and heavily implied that they wanted to have a threesome with me. 

for context, i have ocd with one of my main subtypes being sexual orientation ocd. essentially i get super fixated on my sexuality, if im identifying correctly, etc. logically im aware im a lesbian but so-ocd on top of being told repeatedly by several different people throughout my life that i need to “find the right man” has led me to struggle with my sexuality identity.

anyway, at the time when i first met M i was identifying as a lesbian. i told him i was a lesbian. i was honestly shocked when J told me that they both apparently wanted to sleep with me, but nothing necessarily came of that. i just think of it now as when i first became aware that M was attracted to me.

flash forward two months later. J is hosting a new year’s eve party. once again related to my ocd, i do not drive, so the plan was for her to pick me up that night and help set up for the party. however, she texts me that same day and explains that she tested positive for covid and will be quarantined at her parents house, party was still on since her roommate’s were also hosting but she obviously wasn’t my ride anymore. it wasn’t the end of the world by any means, i could have just ordered an uber or something but J tells me she’s asked her brother to give me a lift over.

i ride over with M and his cousin (H), im told that H 
 will be sleeping over at M’s place and he offers me to crash there too to sleep off the night if drinking. i accept because i was getting along with him and H pretty well and didnt see the harm. 

party happens, it was a fun night all things considered. we headed back to M’s house, i borrowed pajamas off of him, i slept on the couch. 

next morning we all head back out for a quick breakfast and then on our way home. M drops off H first and on the drive to my parents’ house he turned to me and asked if i would be interested in going back to his place instead and “kiss a little”

there was a lot going on in my head at the time. while this felt completely out of left field, in general i never felt like anyone has ever been particularly attracted to me before so i remember being a tad flustered from the attention in general. my so-ocd was going off a bit too - i had never kissed a man before, i had never done anything with a man before. all those thoughts of how i could be ‘sure’ i was gay started up and i thought maybe this could be a way to confirm things for myself.

before anyone says it, i made it completely clear to him why i was doing this. i told M in very plain terms that i “am probably a lesbian” but was willing to try. H also has ocd so the night before we were talking about it fairly extensively and M was present for the conversation so explaining to him that my obsessive compulsive disorder is where this decision was stemming from was a pretty short conversation. M’s response was essentially he didnt care as long as he got a makeout session out of it.

so… we went back to his house. he took me to his room. he kissed me. 

i remember not liking his beard against my face, i remember him pulling my shirt off, i remember him pushing me down onto the bed. he asked me if i wanted to have sex but i immediately told him no, i definitely wasn’t prepared to do anything like that.

he drove me home and asked for a kiss goodbye. i complied but for days i felt so ashamed and embarrassed and gross. i think it was mixture of having actually gone through with that with him and feeling like i used him (or he used me? or both?) and being just so frustrated with myself but also still feeling a bit … excited? that someone was interested in me?

M and i texted a bit on and off until he asked me out on a date. i agreed just as a courtesy. we had a conversation prior before the nye party on the way to pick up H that he didn’t view dates as inherently serious, that sometimes they might just be for fun. i figured thats what this was. 

we went to a small restaurant, he bought me drinks, we talked. he asked if i wanted to watch a movie with him back at his place

i have never held my liquor well. when we got back to his house, he fixed me another drink. i remember sitting on his bed while he put on some program. 

i remember him pulling me to my feet and kissing me, then him starting to pull off my clothes. he never said anything to me, never asked me if he could strip me, i was too scared and too drunk to say anything. 

i was naked on his bed, he started to eat me out, then he started to finger me. i just laid there silently and motionless. i really think i completely left my body. 

he wanted to do so many things to me. he spanked me and made me tell him “thank you” before he started to have sex with me.

im not sure how long he was having sex with me for before this happened but all of a sudden i snapped out of this daze i was in because he pulled out, pulled off the condom, then stuck his dick back in me. i started to panic a little, asking him immediately “what are you doing!?” and M told him that he was losing his erection and just needed to stick it in without a condom on for a bit until he gets it back, but he never put one back on.

he didnt finish inside of me, just on my stomach. he cleaned me up so i ended up trying to fall asleep afterwards. it was really late at this point and i was still pretty drunk and i was so sore and tired. he tried to finger me again but i twisted my body away from him which i guess sent the message.

the following morning he had sex with me twice more. i dont remember the details of these times very well but i remember asking him to take me home after.

logically i understand that he violated me. he never asked for consent, he took the condom off without my permission. i understand on paper that it was assault. not saying no is not a yes, but it happened so fast. i could have told him to stop, i know i could have. i was just so scared. 

its also the fact i didnt stop going to him. i think i was scared since i was friends with J and i had… infiltrated her family? i know i didnt want to cut ties with M and have it affect my friendship with J but the more i think about it now after time to process i think i knew what happened wasnt something i wanted subconsciously but couldn’t accept it. its still hard to wrap my head around it now and i still feel so much shame and guilt.

the next time i saw him he invited me over after my classes. M was WFH so i sat around doing nothing for a bit. eventually he had me sit on the bed with him and we talked about our jobs for a bit. i complained about work and he started to drop hints that i should quit my job (long story - probably for the best as it was a pretty shit job but he kind of bullied me into quitting before i had a new job and it ended with me unemployed for almost a year) 

i remember him asking me how i felt about the sex we had and i told him honestly that i didnt know if i even liked it. M told me that we should “try again” and… then we were. i remember faking moans this time to see if it would feel less uncomfortable.

he ended up telling his sister about us having sex and J asked me about how i felt. i started to talk to her some about how uncomfortable i was during it but she sort of shut the conversation down because she didn’t want to hear about her brother having sex. 

so suddenly all my friends knew what he and i did. i think it sort of pushed me just lean into what *this* was. i didn’t know how to handle it so i decided “okay. i like boys too i guess. i like him.”

all things considered, i did get along with M. we could talk a lot and he liked my jokes, so i started to think this is what i was supposed to do.

however as time continued he would randomly tell me that having a sexual relationship wasnt a good idea and we should stop, only to change his mind days later. we argued a lot and it made me feel so worthless. it felt like he only wanted my body which was such an insane switch up for me. i spent years thinking i was too ugly to be touched to only being valued for a quick fuck.

M also had a huge problem with condoms. the first few times we had sex he would bring up that i should go on BC and when i told him it scared me / didnt protect against STDs he just insisted he was clean. sometimes he ‘forgot’ to put them on or ‘ran out’ but eventually he just started telling me he couldn’t finish with a condom and it didn’t feel right so he just sort of stopped. we never discussed it, he just decided to stop and i didnt know how to voice my discomfort. i know it seems stupid in hindsight but i was so inexperienced and scared. 

we officially dated for only one month. after maybe 2 weeks together he randomly decided he wanted to move across the country and tried to promise that i could “come with him” once i finished school.

he seriously asked me out april 1st and dumped me the 2nd week of may. he moved by june. 

M also randomly told my mother about my ocd diagnosis before i was ready to tell her myself and despite her being very supportive and caring it just wasn’t my decision ultimately - it was his. 

my relationship with M more or less destroyed my friendship with J, save a week in august where she asked me to petsit while she was on a family vacation. this included M stopping in our hometown before leaving with his family.

he was at his sister’s house when i got there, i remember hugging him when i saw him and giving him a kiss on the cheek and he immediately dragged me upstairs into an empty room and kissing me hard. he pulled down my pants and started to eat me out. i remember pulling on him, trying to tell him i didn’t want to do this while his sister was right downstairs. he did stop, but i think more or less because of logistics. 

it was already planned that he would leave the family vacation early and fly back to his place out of my city, so he popped in to see me before he left. M’s birthday had passed shortly before so i gave him some birthday gifts, he wanted to have sex on the floor, then he left.

i briefly had a pregnancy scare shortly after this. according to my period tracker app i had apparently been ovulating when we last had sex and despite having had irregular periods my entire life i got super anxious since my period was like especially late and the entire time i tried to talk to him about my worries he … sent memes. we argued on the phone. 

beginning of 2024 i flew out to see M. we had as much sex as he wanted the entire time. i honestly didn’t even think i had much a choice. i was staying at his place, sleeping in his bed. i ended up missing my flight and staying an additional two days which led to more sex.

shortly after i came home i decided that with the distance between us i wanted to put up some boundaries. i told him i didn’t want to continue a sexual relationship with him if he wasn’t interested in anything more.

he agreed, but a few weeks later sent me sex toys for valentines day. we had a huge fight. i made it even more clear to him that i didn’t want to have that kind of relationship anymore.

things were rocky after that. i ignored him more than not. may of the following year however a friend of mine (whom i had a bit of a crush on that was more or less returned) and i scored vip concert tickets for our favorite band in M’s area, so i reached back out to him on a whim to ask him to pick us up from the airport. he agreed.

we were there a total of three (ish) days. the day we landed, a day for sightseeing as we were in a major city, the concert, and then flying home super early the next morning. after M picked us up he sort of … invited himself to hang out with us. we didnt discourage it since he *did* pick us up from
the airport free of charge. the following day for sightseeing he ended up calling out of work to again come hang out with us.

it was more or less a fun day, but as my friend (P) told me later (this was her first meeting him) M apparently made comments to her about her body and make it very known that he was attracted to her. P didn’t tell me this at the time because she wasn’t sure about my feelings towards him still. 

later he drove us back to our airbnb and sort of invited himself up into our room. it was essentially a hostel, like a super small room. P and i had planned to drink a little bit and work on some freebie bracelets and keychains we wanted to pass out during the concert. we made M a bracelet and he joked that we were “collaring him” 

he eventually left, P and i finished our freebies, next morning we had our concert and then we flew home.

months later M calls me to tell me he was visiting in our hometown and asks if we could hang out. i agreed and we went mini golfing &amp; had dinner. during this time i confided in him that i think im still really just a lesbian and my crush on P.

his response was simply disappointed that “we really will never have sex again” and upon hearing about my feelings for P he said that he was under the impression that she and i apparently wanted to have a threesome with him (newsflash: we didnt) 

i dont remember the entire day aside from that. i do remember him randomly telling me that he could tell ive gained weight despite knowing ive struggled with a restrictive eating disorder in the past.

i also remember finally confessing to M how i felt about that ‘first time’ together, when he took the condom off. i told him about nightmares i had about it. he said he was sorry that it upset me so much.

after he dropped me off i ended up talking with P about what M said to me about the threesome stuff, this is when she told me about his suggestive comments to her and somehow the conversation turned into me telling P about that ‘first time’ with him. this was the first time i ever told another person about that and she very quickly told me in no uncertain terms that he raped me.

it led to such a slew of emotions after the next few days. so much of me still couldnt accept what happened and so i eventually came to the conclusion that he must have not known or realized what he did so my solution was to write M a letter explaining everything and how it made me feel and how it still affects me.

i asked at the end of the letter he leave his sister out of it. i didnt plan on telling anyone else in his life or otherwise. i was still so embarrassed and ashamed. but about a week after i sent the letter i discovered J had blocked me everywhere. 

i dont really know if anyone will read this or care but i still struggle to wrap my head around this whole thing and i just needed to lay it all out as a way to process and possibly get some sort of closure maybe.

Even since primary school, I have felt like a weirdo and an outsider from everyone else. Maybe I don’t know how to socialise or smell bad or something but I would watch as people around me made loafs of friends and bonds with others while I sat their awkwardly not knowing what to say when someone approached me. This carried on with me until the end of school, and the constant loneliness and bullying that came with having no friends was soul crushing. I longed for a close friend that I loved and that we could hang out for ages together, but my longest friendship probably lasted about 2-3 months before ending over a fight. It has to be me right? I told myself over and over again that it wasn’t me, that I’m not weird and that it’s all in my head. The thought of talking to someone now terrifies me and makes me incredibly anxious. When I went to uni I thought I would make a fresh start - try to piece back together my self esteem and confidence in myself. This experience has done nothing but shatter everything I had left. I truly am meant to be alone. I try so hard - I joined sports clubs and stuck with them, I joined societies, I tried just walking up to people on my course and saying hello, but no friendship has come from any of it. I am incredibly upset and so tired from it all. The idea that there’s something wrong with me just crushes me and makes me want to give up completely and not try anymore.",0.1798404,0.071750276,0.02238941,0

I was taking .5 mg of Klonopin every night for about 8 months. I stopped 2 days ago.

Over the last few months, alcohol has been hitting me really strangely. Even with 1–2 drinks, I don’t feel drunk at all — but the next day is guaranteed horrible anxiety, panic, chest tightness, and that “mentally off” feeling. Way worse than any normal hangover.

Is this normal for long-term benzo use?

Hello. I'm not looking for advice or success stories. I just want to hear from people who can relate.

I have depression and I've been on treatment since 2022. I've tried so many medication and none of it was lastingly effective. I feel like I'm rotting on the inside and a husk of a human being on the outside, forcing myself to keep up with life. I don't feel like I'm living. I'm just depleting every remaining ounce of strength in me to pretend to be functional: I wake up with immense dread, shower, endure my cattle-transport like commute, show up for work that I absolutely hate, buy microwaveables because I lost my passion to cook and to nourish myself. On weekends, I see friends that I pretend to be ""normal"" to (I only share my suffering to a very few). Everyday leaves me absolutely drained and exhausted. I'm not interested in anything. My respite is just crawling to bed, watching my trash TV and doom scrolling until I sleep to do the same life-draining routine all over again.  
  
I feel like Sisyphus. Life wasn't this way before. It had sweetness and ease to it, and I see how my husband, family and friends draw enjoyment from life. I'm so miserable not to be able to feel that. I look at how I spend my days and to be honest, if this is life, I don't want to do this anymore. I'm so tired.",0.07291982,0.024124376,0.00847251,0

I’m a teenager and just need to get this off my chest. This happened recently, and I still feel uneasy about it.

We were watching a movie — me, my mom (his grandma), and my two nephews. Their parents (my sister and her husband) were in the kitchen.

We were eating mandarins when suddenly my 4-year-old nephew started choking. He grabbed me, pinched me, and pointed at his mouth. I didn’t understand at first, but then realized he was choking and couldn’t breathe.

I immediately started patting his back, but it didn’t help, so I flipped him upside down and shook him gently — and the piece of mandarin flew out.

He started crying a bit, but then calmed down, and we went back to watching the movie.

Later I told my sister and her husband, but they reacted so calmly — just said, “Well, he choked, but he’s fine now, right?”

Their reaction really shocked me. Why would they act like that? I can’t stop thinking about it.",0.25727063,0.07903719,0.0233943,0

My birthday is tomorrow, and here I am crying my heart out. For the past few months, I’ve realized that I am not hard to love—as a person, as a girlfriend, and as a friend. I’ve gone through so many breakups, whether in friendships or relationships. I used to question myself if it was my fault, but today, October 29, it hit me that I am not hard to love.

I deserve a calm love.
I deserve someone who would ask how my day went.
Someone who would send me flowers.
Someone who would want to meet me every week.
Someone who wants me enough.
Someone who wouldn’t send just a 3-second voice message for the whole day.
Someone who loves themselves but isn’t too selfish to love me too.
Someone who wouldn’t want me just for now, but forevermore.

I ain’t hard to love.
I am not too much.
I am not obsessed.
I am not crazy.

305239906,reddit,Anxiety,1763426553,"Birthday Self Sabotage

So my birthday is coming up, and I the waves of anxiety (and also sadness) have begun. I know it’s completely understandable to cry or be sad on your birthday but I just don’t know how to get past this. 

Last year on my birthday, my family planned a lovely dinner and I was an hour and a half late for it because all I could do was sit on the floor and cry. I couldn’t even articulate to my husband why I was crying, I got snappy and short (he sat with me the whole way bless him) and at each moment, I knew I exactly what I was doing but just could not make myself stop. 

This year is my 30th, and I’ve accomplished so much, logically I know I have. But I just can’t stop sinking into the sadness and panic feeling. My husband has tried to plan a birthday lunch with my loved ones but I just can’t stop sabotaging -  I tell myself that people love me and that they want to do this for me, and then insist he cancels. I make excuses that it’s Sunday, and most people would rather stay in. That I’ll be tired because we have a wedding the night before, or that I won’t want to clean my home after hosting.
It got to a point where yesterday he just said he’s cancel the whole thing, and then I immediately felt incredibly guilty. 
The worst part is that I’m so aware I’m sabotaging I just can’t stop doing it. 

I don’t know what else to do. Does anyone else get this way? How do you manage this? Any advice  would be so appreciated.",0.1013248,0.027841117,0.0070665907,0

I would like to know if anyone else is desperately struggling at first year university, at the academic, social and mental level. 

Currently I’ve failed two mid terms and scraped by with C’s two others midterm, likely due to my lack of preparedness, I’m in STEM
With the standard first year sciences (bio/biochem/chem etc) since my first failed midterms. I’ve beefed up my study habits and started putting a lot more effort in. but still roughly a week behind. Not the end of the world. But i honestly don’t know what I’d do if I don’t pass the seconded round of midterms. 

Skipping past the academic. I’m finding it hard to connect  with people. Nor can I find any friends who I actively like being around. ( small town university 2-3 thousand ish students ) but regardless. I’ve shown up to events and meets but I’m finding it hard to meet people. 
Almost two months in and I hardly talk to anyone besides my roommate who I went to high-school with. 

But generally I’m at the lowest point  it think I have ever been in my life, support from family or friends likely wouldn’t yield any improvement in my situation.

I’ve had a really intense year. “Crazy” doesn’t even begin to describe it, but I think I’m finally starting to heal a little.

Late last year, I was physically assaulted by my partner. Even though deep down I knew things weren’t right, I couldn’t walk away. I loved her, and a part of me still cares about the version of her that I believed in. After the assault, I was told not to say anything to my doctors or the police because it could get her in trouble. I kept quiet for a while, trying to protect her, even though I was the one who needed help.

Things got worse in March. I don’t remember everything clearly, but after a bad argument, I overdosed on my medication. I genuinely don’t know how I survived that night. I ended up detained in hospital, confused, lost, and barely able to make sense of what had happened. My memory from that time is still patchy, but what I do remember is feeling completely betrayed and broken.

When she found out the police were involved, she left the country. Later she came back and started spreading rumours about me, even filed a counter-complaint to try to paint herself as the victim. I realised then that maybe I wasn’t the one who had done something wrong; I had just been manipulated into thinking I was.

Since then, I’ve been fighting for accountability. I filed a small civil claim, not for money, but for truth. I wanted the court to hear what really happened. Things got messy, and there were attempts from both families to “settle it quietly,” even when I was in the hospital after another suicide attempt. But I refused. I didn’t want silence; I wanted justice.

Eventually, I applied for a non-molestation order and won. That gave me some protection, but more importantly, it gave me validation that I wasn’t imagining any of this.

In the past eight months, I’ve survived eight serious suicide attempts. Some of them left scars that will stay with me forever. I’ve been diagnosed with complex PTSD, and recovery has been far from easy. But I’m alive and that alone means I still have a chance to get my shit together and fight for myself.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that it really does get better. Slowly, painfully, and sometimes with setbacks, but it does. I’m still working through it all the trauma, the legal fight, the memories but I’m also starting to rediscover life again.



If you’re in that dark place right now, please hold on. You’re not weak for breaking down. You’re not hopeless for struggling. You’ve just been through too much, and you deserve peace. I promise you, one day you’ll look back and realise you made it through things you never thought you’d survive. I did, somehow. And I’m still here. ❤️",0.10826672,0.038566336,0.0055866763,0

I met her three years ago and she was the closest friend I've ever had, which are find to hard as I'm autistic and struggle with all that. She was the kind of friend whom you could tell her anything and she would be kind, supportive and open-minded. She loved to draw and bake cookies, and friendly and funny. She wss everyone's friend.

Some months ago she converted to christianism and changed completely. She was still kind, but different, more distant. I'm an atheist, but I supported her with it. I've always told her what mattered to most to me for her was that she could find peace and happiness, which apprently happened after converting, so of course I was as supportive as I could, and respectful, because I respect whatever religion people are. After this change, we stopped talking a lot, she stopped talking about what she liked, about her cookies and pound cakes, about her drawings and paintings and the anime she liked to watch. She would just talk about her religion and whatever her pastor had told her. I would listen to her even if I didn't understand, because the brief moments I could talk to her were a joy.

But she talked completely different. It was as if someone replaced her and was pretending to be her. It freaked me out more than once. 

Anyway, yesterday she finally told me she wanted to cut ties with me, because ""our ideals are different from each other"" (her words. Makes sense since our beliefs are the opposite) and because she needed christian friends. I asked her if she couldn't have christian friends besides us (another friend in common and me), and she didn't answer me. She told me she still loved me and that she wouldn't be this person now without me (I supported her a lot in her hard times and encouraged her to find her own happiness). We parted well, but I still feel awful. I mean I feel it is ironic since its true, I did help her, which ended up in all this.

I'm not that close with the other friend, so now I'm basically a loser with no friends, since no one in my new university likes me. Yay.",0.11098998,0.029383656,0.08749158,0

I&#039;m not the least bit suicidal and I am definitely not happy all the time. Most people aren&#039;t. You should have different emotional responses to different experiences, and some of those experiences are negative. That is outside your control. The vast majority of people have negative experiences on a daily basis, to varying degrees, but the accumulation of these experiences over the course of their life has given them coping mechanisms to deal with emotions like disappointment, fear, anger, frustration, sadness, etc, so that the emotion is experienced and then moved on from. New experiences wash out bad experiences, and instead of permanently cataloguing every negative thing into permanent long term memory we learn to forget most of the details of our experiences, good and bad, and reserve long-term memory for only the most significant. <br><br>This is why a toddler will scream and cry because of disappointment over mommy not buying them candy at the supermarket, but a 20 year old realizing his bank balance won&#039;t allow him to buy everything he wants simply sighs and then figures out what he has to put back on the shelf. That same 20 year old might cry and be inconsolable after breaking up with his first girlfriend, or having his first family member die. The same man at 60 will have experienced more heartbreak, more death, and it will likely not consume as much of his emotional resources to move past each new person lost. It&#039;s not that he won&#039;t feel sad or bereft, he will simply be able to cope with it better. <br><br>Suicidal people simply don&#039;t know how to cope. They hyper-fixate on negative experiences, create delusional or unrealistic standards for happiness, and essentially make themselves miserable. There are people who exist in truly hopeless lives, people trapped in slavery for example, but the vast majority of suicides are not slaves.

145475787,reddit,offmychest,1762304470,"I became a cheater

People often say they will never do something even if the situation happens to them. I was firm believer in that, but I've become everything that I never wanted to be. If you read all of this, I'm sorry. 

I've never really had a bf my whole life, I've always been to myself, reserved, but also out-going. I never thought about drinking or partying, but I was never opposed to it. I just liked watching anime, drawing, working out and studying for the things that matter the most to me. My life literally changed when I met my bf. My 2nd year in college I had new roommates and one was by far the wildest (Christi). She introduced me to my  bf because he never lost his V-card. She wanted me to get to know him and see what happens. Little did they know, I was a virgin too. Long story short, my bf and I were pressured into having sex, but in the end, we started to date. 

In the beginning, I never thought about dating because I thought it would distract me from my degree and it did a little. Our relationship was great in the beginning, probably because I ignored every red flag known to man. Love makes you blind right? He is the sweetest, most loving and doting person I've ever met. He will always talk about you and things he wants to do with you. He'll plan cute dates and do things he doesn't like just to make you happy. Perfect guy right? 

Its now been six years with him and he continues to do those things, but there's always a catch to everything. He is always angry, takes it out on anything around him. He will always make it sound like you pulled the trigger to all his problems, but claim he's just stressed. Always lying about the smallest things. He has the biggest gambling problem and would continue to lie about his spending. If you left one item out, he would have a melt down about it. Just living was an issue for him. I tried leaving him multiple times, but he had a way of making me stay. 

Once we graduated college in 2022, I began applying and so did he. He found the job first and wanted me to move with him. I wanted to start my career, but he had a way to make it problem to be far away from each other. So I did what any dumb women would do.  I followed him and gave up so many opportunities. That year, he became distant, wouldn't talk to me and would go out more. One day I found out he was paying for OF and spoke to women while we were just dating. He would also talk about a coworker daily and claimed he never had feelings for her; however she would never want to have a conversation with me during events. 

I became very insecure and secluded. I had no one or family. There were no jobs in my field and he was angry that I did not have much money. During this time I went back home quite often because a close family member was passing away from cancer. Due to this I had no money for gifts and he claimed I was not trying hard enough and I was useless. Worst year of my life. 

Now fast forward in 2023. He got an offer for a job outside the state because of someone he knew. I told him I need to find my career first. He did not like that, so he promised me he would stop gambling and get help. He told me he would take care of everything until I found a job in my field. Again, I believed him. I moved with him just for him to do it all over again. Gambling and yelling at me for not finding a job soon enough. No one would hire me, stating I don't have enough experience. I decided to find a random job that opened the doors to many friendships and comfort. He realized I finally had money and support. My bf did not like that I would go out every couple of weeks and work constantly. If I had no money he would yell, if I had money for us, he would yell at me. 

Me and my friends decided to plan a trip to cancun. I was excited because I've never put myself first or treated myself to anything. I was very excited and he was angry with me. Our relationship was already falling apart and he continued to gamble stating it was because of me always working. This was the first lie I've ever told him. This is an all girls trip only. It was actually my 2 friends and their partners. That was done last minute. I didn't want my bf to join due to him always getting angry during trips together. I went to mexico and had the best time of my life until I made a choice to cheat on him.

My bf called me during this trip and stated he went to gamble despite my plee for him to stop. I felt destroyed that he was never going to change. That night I got drunk and danced with a stranger which led to one night stand. I don't really remember much, but I know I made the conscious choice to sleep with him. I had no regret for my actions. I just felt terrible that I became the person I said I would never be. A Cheater. 

As the year went by, I tried multiple times to leave, but he would not let me. He would claim I gave up on him and he would end his life if I left. I finally became completely numb to his existence. 

Now mid 2025, I met a guy that was nice, but honest. He stopped by my workplace and we had simple conversation while I was helping him out. An hour later, he came back and gave me a flower with his number on it. That's were my cheating began again.

I continued to meet with him and it has been amazing. Its the same feeling I felt when I was in love. I've become passionate about my career again. During this time, I've continued to try to leave, but my current bf is making it hard. 

Now I've become a cheater to not only my first partner, but to the new guy I am seeing. I know this is a terrible thing and I will never condone my actions. Cheating is a choice. I just hate how I got this far and why its become so hard for me to choose. Someone's heart is going to break regardless. I just wish I wasn't so scared of making a choice. Yet cheating was easy for me to do right?

This is my secret. Call me what I know I am. I know I need to end both relationships and focus on myself. This my 2025. Most of all I am sorry to my younger self.",0.23667802,0.07903719,0.034042787,0

408955823,reddit,offmychest,1764138200,"I genuinely can’t keep a job

I got laid off from my fourth entry level position in the span of 1.5 years today. I was an intake specialist, an admin assistant, whatever other bullshit word they wanted to use for an adult babysitting/punching bag. All it takes is one person at the firm to not like you for reasons you can’t control, and boom! You’re unemployed. I can’t even find a job anymore without questions in the interview about why I wanted to leave. “Well, gee, I got fired”. 

 I show up everyday. Not a single day late or absent. I got along with coworkers. I worked through lunch until I was told I needed to take one. (Hourly salary). I worked *fucking hard everyday* and asked for help and training. Each time I get blown off because everyone is so busy keeping their own head above water. 

My response to why I’m seeking another job without saying I got laid off: 

“Well, I decided to pivot towards a more research/output focused position and I needed more hands on training” aka I got sick of being a receptionist that got a random assortment of tasks to complete with no help or training. After I’d sit for an hour with an urgent question, I learned to stop asking and figure it out on your own. Only for them to penalize you for doing it wrong. You want initiative? Not that kind of initiative though. 

I’m fully aware of my weaknesses (customer interaction)… The ONLY roles available right now are retail and customer service based jobs. I am on the autism spectrum, I cannot work with people like that. I’ve said this so many times now I want to scream. No workplace is friendly towards neurodivergence, period. 

All entry level positions want you to have 2-5 years of goddamn experience and refuse to train, let alone give the kind of hands on training that I disclose to them in the interview that I NEED. 

I am sorry if this is an unstructured rant, I’m just so tired. I’m so frustrated. I’m broke, cavities in my teeth and no health insurance to fix it. I don’t want to work in a fucking Amazon factory bro. That’s the only option atp. It’s killing me. I don’t have a degree. I couldn’t afford it. I had no guidance growing up, nobody - including myself - ever had to foresight to say “stay in school or you’ll be miserable for the rest of your adult life”. All I have is about five years of retail/legal/reception experience, and maybe three jobs left I can apply to in this shit-hole city. There’s no tech companies or banks, data driven work to be found. There’s one major retailer and Amazon, some fast food joints. I’m not the type of personality that can do reception work. 

Nobody can keep me long enough to get my foot in the door “the old fashioned way”. I can’t do it anymore. I can’t take the embarrassment of losing another job, I can’t take the depression that follows from sitting at home alone all day. It’s going to kill me.",0.45549932,0.3388922,0.10221587,0

So i was just chilling downstairs listening to music nothing to crazy right (it might’ve included a little karaoke) but this was around 11pm right 
So after that time i turned the volume down to 10 maybe 11 which is obviously very lowwww
I was still downstairs by the time of 1AM i repeAt AM and someone rang my doorbell..
I got a lot of anxiety and trauma aswell so i ran to the wall where you cant see me if you look into the windows CAUSE THE CURTAINS WERE OPEN
I was frozen couldn’t move cause i was so scared 
A few moments later i hear knocking on the window which scared me even more..
My phone was still on the chair at this point 
And my little black jackrussel between my legs cause she was scared to bless her
At some point i was brave enough to crawl and get my phone THEN they knocked again on the window what the actual F
Why on earth would you do such thing? The music wasn’t loud at all with proof cause my mom was literally fast asleep upstairs (and she doesn’t sleep that great just like me)
Anyways at some point i managed to ‘man’ up (ironically) i got myself together to close the blinds which are like 5 steps towards the window i was bloody scared but i had to luckily there was no one there and i closed the blinds but really.. im still anxious…
Tomorrow ill know who it was cause my mom has the video doorbell app on her phone 
Im guessing it were my neighbors uhg.. out of this world, worst thing is that these people know what i’ve been through cause they lived next door at the time..

Most of the time I lie about what I want, just to avoid being judged. But it hurts, because I know I’m not doing anything wrong.

And today someone judged me after I confessed that I want a relationship with an older man. But they always get it wrong.

For me, an age gap isn’t about sexual needs. It’s about finding someone who feels like both a father figure and a lover, someone who truly understands me and stays no matter what.

I have BPD, and I know I’m not easy to handle or to love. I push people away because I’m terrified of being abandoned. But deep down, I just want that one person who gets me, who can see my fragility and still love me through my chaos.

Someone who can be gentle when my mood swings hit, when I split, when my anger, anxiety, and depression take over. Someone who keeps reassuring me that I’m not too much. That I’m still lovable. 

And honestly, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with wanting this kind of love. I just turned 20, and people love to judge me for it. They’re like, ‘you have daddy issues, blah blah blah.’ Okay, maybe I do, but so what? Just leave me alone.",0.20056234,0.033790905,0.018872296,0

i spent the last 5 days in and out of clinics, throwing up until there was nothing left and i still have probably another week to go.

i shouldn't be salty or upset but i am, and i'm even more upset i did it to myself too by checking to see if he would replace me while i was sick.

but the (white?) lie bugs me most; he told me he'd just use the week to rest but then he posted that.

What I mean is... Like it's not about my body really. I like my physical body quite a bit. But I noticed that I am extremely insecure about existing in sexual context. Like... I can't help but feel stress during flirting, I feel extremely awkward, trying not to be weird and... Well... That couses me looking weird lol. It seems like I never able to find the right words, right gestures. Usually I make the other person laugh or correct me. 

And like... I'd gladly just let them make the first move and then match the attitude but I'm a guy so... 8 times out of 10 I'm supposed to do start the game and it's terrifying.

Boyfriend wants to buy a motorbike, he’s only gotten into them recently but we’ve been together for 3 years. I do truly love him, but that’s why I wouldn’t be able to stick around. 

I’ve tried to discuss the risks and that I’m quite scared but he’s been brushing me off a bit, now he’s actually saved enough and he’s eyeballing some models he’s ready to buy. 

I can be a bit of a panicky person but I’ve really tried to keep my cool about this, I don’t want him to feel pressured out of buying one, just because I’m a scaredy cat. I haven’t given him an ultimatum or told him that our relationship will have to end, I’m not that kind of person. 

Extra context, I work in emergency medicine and I’ve seen too much heartbreak around those who do and don’t survive crashes. I have no doubt he’d be a good rider, it’s just motorcyclists are so vulnerable on the road and in our area people drive like maniacs too.

I can’t convince myself to eat.
I have lost a lot of weight this month. I cant seem to convince myself to eat or take care of myself.
I feel like it is an injustice to care for myself. I think I deserve this. 

I also dont allow myself any pleasurable things. I dont play games or do my hobby. I am focused on saving as much money as I can and I have eliminated all hobbies.
I have taken on far more classes and work than I think I can handle. 
I am doing that last part to teach myself how to be strong and less lazy, and I deserve the struggle. 

Any time I interact with my family I somehow upset them. I am fundamentally messed up. 

I am also lazy and always have been.

So I havent been eating. I do not feel pleasure when I consume food. And at this point, it is a huge discomfort to eat. I feel better off when I dont.
But I also dont drink much water, a bottle in the morning and one at night. I cant bring myself to do it. Because when I do I feel sick. 

I believe I deserve this and I can handle it. Any time I am in pain I do not try to avoid it. 
I feel like I am losing that instinct. I could burn myself cooking and hardly react. I never go out of my way to harm myself and I do not want to, but this development is strange and not appropriate. 

Im not sure where this mindset came from. Or how to get rid of it if I should.

In the south however, it was significantly less so; women were allowed to work and read like the men, sure, but the government allowed for them to work as prostitutes for the occupying American GIs in various parts of the country near military installations (like the &quot;Monkey House&quot; in Dongducheon).

Im only 22 but ive completely given up all hope that ill ever ammount to anything. At 18 i stupidly decided i was going to go to college and major in psychology. I planned to go on to med school for psychiatry. I realized far too late my heart wasnt in it and that i just wanted to do it cause i thought it sounded cool and made a lot of money. I went ahead and finished my last 2 semesters and graduated 6 months ago. Everyone was so proud and happy for me but i nearly cry everytime someone asks me about college or my career goals. I have no idea what i want to do with my life and i have a really shitty degree that holds no value really. I may have graduated on time with a good GPA and minimum debt but i still dont feel like i ""succeeded"" in any way that matters. I have applied for hundereds of jobs from several months before graduation till now. Ive had several interviews but i havent been good enough to win jobs against other, better people.

I currently work for 50 cents above minimum wage at a local gas station and there is no indication ill ever find anything else despite applying for every job near me that pays at least 15 an hour. Things will only get harder and harder based on what ive heard in the news. Jobs will get harder to find and expenses will keep rising. It will be hard for a prepared person to survive the future economy, idk how ill stand a chance. I rely on my family for housing and many other things, the only real bills i have is car insurence and soon ill have student loans. Once my family are no longer arround or willing to support me ill be boned. I know its common to live with family till late 20s/early 30s but i have no faith ill be independant by then.

Hi everyone. I’m a senior in high school and for about 7 months, I’ve been going through one of the darkest periods of my life. I used to be a good student with great grades, but now my results have dropped a lot, even though I’m working harder than ever.

My future feels like it’s collapsing in front of me. My parents are worried, I’m terrified, and I feel like I’m disappointing everyone and destroying every chance I had. I’m scared of ending up in a life I don’t want.

I don’t have close friends. I’m carrying everything alone. On top of school, I’m dealing with personal problems I can’t talk about, and it feels like everything is piling up on my shoulders.

Lately, the feeling of hopelessness has become so strong that I don’t see any reason to keep going. I don’t want to pretend I’ve reached a point where not living feels easier than continuing like this.

But the only reason I’m writing this is because there’s still a very small part of me that says “wait… maybe things can get better.” That part is getting smaller every day, and I’m scared it will disappear completely if I don’t reach out.

I know I’m not the only one with problems. I know other people suffer too, and I don’t think my pain is more important than anyone else’s. But right now, I’m drowning, and I don’t know how to stop myself from going under.

I don’t know how to process this so I’m putting it here.

I studied so hard for my midterm that I barely slept. My anxiety was eating me alive, but I pushed through. When I got my score back, a 92, I felt this tiny spark of pride I rarely ever feel.

Then my professor looked at me like he didn’t recognise me and said:

“Your score is unusual” And I said, ""Excuse me? Are you suspecting my score?""He just smiles and nothing

No congratulations. No warmth.Just cold suspicion.

Like all the effort I poured into this just… didn’t count because it came from me. I walked out feeling small in a way I haven’t felt in years.

That night I couldn’t stop replaying it. The doubt. The embarrassment. So I ended up opening my ""treehole"", cuz I needed to talk to someone, even if it wasn’t a close friend. There’s this guy I’ve matched with from Sparkrizz before. And then I told him the whole story.He said,“Maybe your professor can’t imagine anyone doing better than he ever could. Some people attack or show a mean aspect of what they don’t understand.”That hit me than I expected. I just needed someone to understand how painful it is to work so hard and still be treated like you cheated your way there.I didn’t cry, but I came close.

I have a coworker who was hired in an admin role, but her past experience shows she's way overqualified for the role and it's causing problems. Examples include:
- she keeps trying to take over work assigned to me
- she keeps pretending I wasn't involved in work that I'd done
- she takes credit for work that my colleagues have done (and mine)
- she is condescending to me in front of our peers 
- she keeps half assing her job to the point that our leader has delegated her admin tasks to me, taking away from my own normal work


And the thing is, our leader and everyone around us LOVES her because she's smart with her words and easy to talk to. But my colleague and I end up picking up her slack. And because im senior to her, I don't think it's wise to retaliate because it will look like I'm being a bully. But lately I've been coming home angry and seething from it all.

I’ve been struggling with treatment resistant depression for over two years.

I’ve tried exactly 20 meds over the years. Antidepressants made me go completely insane (one of them gave me a psychotic break), antipsychotics numbed down to the point where I couldn’t have a conversation with more than one or two short sentences. 

But two months ago I started lithium and titrated up to 900mg. It’s the only medicine that didn’t give me bad side effects and it’s been very helpful to control my mood, irritability and SI. Compared to the hell I’ve been with other meds, lithium has been a godsend. However, I’m still fairly depressed and stay around 20h a day rotting in bed. 

I have no other medicine option to try and I want to have faith in lithium. Has anyone had any sucess in overcoming unipolar depression with lithium alone?",0.103494145,0.03412145,0.004846719,0

Ive had several random panic attacks this year that were very brutal, and as I’m sure you all know once you have a bad episode you can’t help but ruminate on how scary it was for weeks. 

For me the worst part is that they come on randomly and without warning, i could be feeling fine then I feel that slight panic build, then that spirals into a full blown panic attack. 

I have a wedding coming up where I’m a groomsman and I can’t stop worrying that I’m going to have an episode right before the ceremony starts. I have lorazepam .5 mg that I never use but they’re there just in case. I know mixing benzos with drinks is bad, but I’m wondering if I took .5mg an hour or two before the ceremony and had a couple drinks (2-3 beers, or 1 shot and a beer) if I would be okay? If it were up to me I wouldn’t drink until later in the night but I know the other groomsmen will want to drink beforehand.

39776,reddit,Anxiety,1761088895,"Prednisone &amp; Anxiety

Hi all! Long story short, I was prescribed prednisone (20mg tablets) to take twice a day this past Saturday after a mild allergic reaction. I started it with a double dosage on Saturday night, took one in the afternoon and one at night on Sunday, and one in the afternoon and one at night on Monday.

The issue is, Monday morning, I woke up feeling okay, but as I was driving to work, I felt anxiety hit me like a truck. I’ve dealt with mild anxiety before, but this was the worse I’ve ever felt before. My whole body was uncontrollably shaking, I was getting flush, I had this feeling of a lump in my throat. This intense episode lasted for about 2 hours before I was able to calm down, but even then, I was jittery and I still had that lump feeling.

Monday night I was a little jittery, but I didn’t have another episode like this and I was mostly able to sleep fine set aside waking up twice in the night.

After doing some research on prednisone, I decided to stop taking it after 3 days even though they gave me 5 days worth. 

Today, Tuesday, I woke up and felt ok. The lump feeling was a lot smaller, and the morning was fine. Right around 1pm though, my body started shaking, and I was freaking out. The lump feeling in my throat returned but felt even worse – I was coughing and dry heaving. I could still swallow water so I know my throat wasn’t closing, but I felt like it was going to. I was freaking out so much I considered calling into the ER, but I rode it out, and after about 2 hours, I was able to calm down.

Does anyone have any experience with this or how long it lasts? My last dose of prednisone was Monday night, and I didn’t except to still feel it on Tuesday. It’s really dehabilitating because I lose two hours of my workday spent in an absolute panic and thinking my heart is going to burst because it’s beating so fast. Is there anything I can do? I try grounding techniques, but it’s like I’m 100% out of control of my body and after, I’m so tired and my eyes are so heavy.",0.0414203,0.013516913,0.0061046463,0
291471168,reddit,depression,1763306447,"Not suicidal but thinking about it

I grew up being skinny and poor. I grew up wanting to fall in love and have a good woman. I never met my dad so half my family was gone in the beginning.

My mother passed away in 2011 and my half brother 2 years ago. I have no family.

I was married in 2015. I had a family and a home. That got dissolved due to her getting lazy. I couldn't let it go...

I have kids that never want to talk to me due to my drinking.

As a result of the divorce I became an alcoholic. But, it hasn't helped very much. I lost all my cars. I ran away from the home I owned because being there kept me depressed and drinking too much. So I ran.

I became homeless and worked for people for 10 dollars an hour. I couldn't save any money to get back ahead and get my life back together.

I am a highly skilled carpenter. 

My friend Austin picked me up and got me off of the streets. He saved my life. He's a really good guy but a bit young and immature.  He is kind of hard to live with but I feel the need to help him any way I can. I got him a job making more money.

I was working for a lady and staying in her camper for about 2 weeks. She got tired of me being drunk and packed my things. I got everything but a few Tools and my license, social security card, and birth certificate. 

My last employer worked me for a week and did not pay me. He strung me along for another week in hopes that I still had a job and would get paid.

I wasn't looking for a woman but one night I decided to message women over Facebook dating. I found a woman who is 18 years older then me. She told me that I couldn't fall in love with her but I did.

I've never even met her...

Last night I got drunk and totally went off on her for no reason. Sadness because I couldn't see her.

I woke up this morning and checked my phone and couldn't believe the things I said...

Now, I probably lost her.

I'm not suicidal but it seems like it would be easier to just end things. I mean we all go there eventually anyways.

I am highly depressed. I don't want to be here anymore.",0.1996317,0.06599696,0.08831879,0

This is called the _anxious-avoidant trap_. The reason people in an anxious-avoidant relationship find it particularly hard to move toward more security is primarily because they are trapped in a cycle of exacerbating each other’s insecurities. People with an anxious attachment style cope with threats to the relationship by trying to get close to their partner. People who are avoidant have the opposite reaction. They cope with threats by taking measures to distance themselves from their partners. The closer the anxious person gets, the more distant the avoidant acts. One partner’s response reinforces the other’s in a vicious cycle, and they both remain within the relationship “danger zone.”</span>",0.09308127,0.031256735,0.027413858,0

Um okay this is gonna sound really weird but i think i can never be friends with boys. Mostly every boy near me hates me (including my crush) alot and i actually kinda know why. I am in a sports academy and there's this girl who has always been my rival since i was 8 (i m 16 now) she was always the winner and i was always at the 2nd place. Everybody used to favour her alot and even the coaches. The boys were literally her slave, she badmouthed me, told everyone i was rude and basically said alot of lies abt me. It was till last year. I was basically an outcast. Last year she changed her academy for a bit and i actually proved myself and also improved my game. I finally won against her last year(ts year too) and thats when somethings became normal. The main topic is that boys still hate me because of my behavior what they assumed (because of her rumours). And theres this boy (call him A) i have liked since 2023. He is so kind and handsome but for some reason he hates me alott like he cant bare to see his friends even talk to me. Ik its so childish but why? I got to know that he hates me because once his bsf hated me (thats called loyalty wow) (also me and his bsf did have some beef but its all sorted out this month) also fyi his bsf and he lived near my rivalry (call her B). I dont understand that i cant seem to make any male friends everybody at the end gets beef with me and i dont know whats wrong with my attitude???? Is B actually that good? Idk man its bad but

Okay, okay — before anyone comments that this has been asked a million times before, I get it, and I’m sorry if it’s repetitive. But here’s the context:

I (M23) am worried that I won’t be able to have sex with my girlfriend (F23) because of my penis size. The last time I measured, I was about 6.6 inches in length and 5.8 inches in girth. My girlfriend is around 5’3” and maybe 130 pounds soaking wet.

I’m a virgin, so I’ve never done this before. Will my size be a problem? I know vaginal canals can vary, but if my size could cause her any discomfort or pain, what can I do to prevent that? I really don’t want to have sex if it’s uncomfortable for her — honestly, her pleasure and comfort are probably gonna be what gets me off more so than the physical stimulation on my end.",0.50503236,0.086852804,0.056582913,1

last night i went out with 3 of my friends (all 18) and one of them ended up throwing up in the club and we got kicked out. we went back to my flat because it was the closest to the club, so we all stayed in my flat until 2 of my friends decided to leave at around 1am, just before the friend who was throwing up started to fall asleep in bed.

i’ve never dealt with someone throwing up from too much alcohol, so the 2 friends gave me a few tips on what i needed to do to make sure she was okay. i stayed up for a while since i recalled my friend saying their partner would message them when they got back to their house, and my friend was gonna order an uber once their partner was home. it was around 2:30am when my friend woke up and i was about to fall asleep. instead of insisting my friend should stay in my flat, i let them get an uber back to their partner’s.

today i needed to give something back to one of my friends cuz they left something at my flat and i told them all the information i’ve just said, and they seemed really disappointed that i let them get the uber. they said “i understand it was your first time dealing with somebody in a situation like this” but they seemed upset about it and now i just feel really really awful about my choices.

427656093,reddit,Anxiety,1764249068,"I Got Prescribed Propranolol Today 18 M

I really hope i don’t offend anyone with this post but today i saw a mental health nurse. The appointment was made by my dad after i told my parents about my drug use and being stressed about college. 

So i went into the appointment and answered the questions etc (didnt mention about drug use)

I went to this appointment for my parents not for me.

To further elaborate on my drug use, i was tweaking off three different substances and wanted to kms and was searching for heroin to end it and snapped out of it and built up the courage to tell my parents what was going on

So anyways I have been diagnosed Propranolol which i know is the weakest medication i could have probably got.

But she explained it will reduce my adrenaline etc. And i dont know if this will offend anyone but personally I DO NOT WANT THAT. 
The fast hearbeat, the sweating, the short breaths. It makes me feel like a normal human being. I dont want to be numbed of that feeling, even if it doesnt dome any good. I understand anxiety can be terrible and people can have full blown panic attacks and put themselves in a critical state. but my anxiety isnt like that. Its stress about college, a girl i like, my job.

I know people are going to be like “just dont take it then” but i just dont know how my parents will react. Thinking about doing it is just making me depressed and i know as someone who is not shy from illegal substances this sounds silly, but i would much rather something that affected my brain and not my heart.",0.067380086,0.025929155,0.0058826595,0

I don’t really know why I’m writing this here. Maybe because I have no one else to talk to, or maybe because I never really had anyone in the first place.

When I was eleven, I lost my mother, the only person who truly cared about me. My father is an alcoholic who used to treat her terribly, and I know that pain is what took her away. Since then, I’ve been living with my aunt, my mother’s sister. I call her “mom,” but it doesn’t feel real. Her affection often feels forced, like something she shows only when others are watching.

I barely have any real friends anymore. The few I had drifted away after I left my father’s home. The people I talk to online are distant too. They only speak to me in group chats, but never reach out otherwise. It feels like I’m invisible, like I could disappear and no one would notice.

On top of that, I face racism and religious jokes more often than I’d like to admit. I’m Black and Muslim, and somehow that’s enough for people to mock or judge me. Even some people I thought were my friends make jokes that cut deep, and then call it humor. It hurts, even when I try to act like it doesn’t.

Sometimes it feels like I don’t belong anywhere. My family is broken, my friendships are fading, and I’m just exhausted. I keep pretending I’m fine, but most days it feels like I’m just existing, not really living.

I’m not looking for sympathy or advice. I just needed to say this somewhere, because holding it in is starting to feel unbearable.",0.22043827,0.1087965,0.042550452,0
